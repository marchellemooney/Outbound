I'm my my name is Kylie. I'm I'm actually a salon owner. I work for Mango Mint. And I came across your website, and I love your branding. And so I just wanted to reach out I did also see that you were using Vagaro. And I was just curious to know, like, how they've been working for you, you know, if you really like them, if things that you wish were a little bit better."

Don't know. Have you ever heard of Mingle Mint before? So we're, like, an all in 1 platform. So we're kind of, like, the next step from Vagaro. Our our system's a lot smoother, and we're more focused on client experience as well as, like, your experience, getting people to come back in, getting people to purchase memberships, packages, purchase more products based off of their services, that kind of a thing. And so yeah. What I do is, like, a 20 minute screen share. Just to, like, walk you through, like, current customers of ours. It's just education. And just kinda show you, Mangament, just kinda get like, an idea of, like, a comparison between Vagaro and Manglement and see if just potentially we could be a good fit. If not, like, today, maybe in, like, 6 months or a year, whenever it is. Just to kinda show you what else is out there. Do you have time to do that on Monday And what is a good email to send over some more info and a link to join the call? Okay. Is it and is and in there? Okay. Okay. Okay. Just wanted to double check. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Perfect. And then that's at g mail? Okay. Awesome. And okay. Let's see. What time on Monday works best for you?"

You can even have clients upload photos when they're booking. We don't have logins. And then as well, we have, like, image markups, and then we have all of the normal stuff of, like, inventory and payroll, and then, like, communications as well. And so, yeah, I actually found I'm sorry. Yes. We do have so our loyalty program's a little different that's built into it. Is that what you're talking about? Okay. Yeah. So, we actually have like, you can set it up if somebody spends a certain amount. You can give them a a client balance, or you can even send them, like, an offer code so they 20% off of their next service. That kind of a thing. So it just kinda you can kind of customize it and set it up how you would like. And so And I did see that you were using Square. I'm quite familiar with them. I use them in the past. But I was just curious to know, like, your experience with them, like, things that you really like, if there's anything that you wish that they had or wish worked a little bit better."

I don't I know that it's, like, super new for you, so I don't know if it's something that you would want to do. But I just do an educational screen share with a coworker of mine. And we just kind of, like, show you current customers very similar to your setup. Kind of spa, med spa, and show you our online booking, how that works. We also have, like, service customization. So you can either ask questions or that can be for add on. So add, like, you know, $15 to the service as well as the 5 minutes it takes to do that extra treatment, that kind of a thing. And kinda just show you it and then kinda show you the back end. I like to think of us so what like, what makes us different from Square, what makes us different from RepeatMD is that we're more focused RepeatMD can also it's more of like a a doctor's office type of software. And then Square is kind of more of, like, salons and spas and yoga studios. So they kinda do a little bit of everything. But they didn't originally start out doing beauty stuff. So MangoMint, it's very intentional with every single feature that we have. It's built to to actually fit the services that you're doing. As well as just saving you time. So it's it's less like, when you're going through the actual software, it's a lot less clicks. It's easier to find things, and then it's just really easy for clients to book. And it's just very transparent on, like, what is available and which all booking softwares do, but we just kinda do a little bit differently. So I mean, I would love to show you. Okay. Okay."

Okay. Just like to double check. I'm in Mountain Standard, so I'm just an hour ahead. So just wanna make sure I'm booking it for the right time. Okay. I'm gonna send that over. I'm also gonna send over that trial account. The cool thing about it is so you don't have to put a credit card or anything like that in, but it's in demo mode. That's fake clients and fake services. It also has fake credit cards, you can actually, like, check them out. You can play around with the forms, what that looks like. If you have time, that's great. If not, totally fine. I just like because I am visual as well. I'm a hairstylist, and so I like to be, like, very hands on and, like, like, actually work with the software to see if it's gonna work. So I'll send that over as well. And then is this the best phone number to reach you at? Okay. And does it receive text messages? Okay. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Awesome. I'll just text you from my personal cell just in case if something pops up and you need to change the time or if you have any questions. Just let me know, and then I can, like, hop into your trial account and build something out for you or whatever if you need anything. My name is Kylie. Mhmm. I spell it with a c. It looks a little funny. Yeah. And we'll be meeting with Amy. Amy has been in the beauty for, like, 22 years, and she's been with Mango Mint for quite a while. So she just is really good with, like and also with MedSpa. She knows a lot more about MedSpa. Spas than I do. So I just like to bring her in because she's kind of like an oracle. As far as questions go. So so okay. Well, I will see you then, and I will follow-up. Okay? Okay. Of course. Have a good 1. Goodbye."

So really focused on client experience, just making it as easy as possible, But, also, our focus is, like, in our mission is what we say it is is just to make businesses more profitable. And so I actually found you online, and I love your branding. I mean, obviously, you've seen your website. It's really beautiful. And so I just wanted to send that gift over as, like, a little bit of love and support. I did see that you were using Square. And so I was curious to know, like, how they're working for you. If there's things that you really like about them or features that you wish that they had. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's been okay. Mhmm. Oh, okay. Uh-huh. Are you doing, like, forms and memberships and packages, that kind of a thing? Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And does that work? Fine? Mhmm."

They have done some updates and stuff since I've used them. So but I I talked to so many people about it. Like, a a little comparison between Mango Mint and Square We're kind of, like, Online booking, it's rebranded to you as we don't have logins, so it makes it really easy for clients to book. It makes it it quicker. A lot of people that switch over to us actually see an increase in bookings because it's so easy to for clients to book. And then also on top of that, our online booking has, like, service customizations. So they can add, like, you know, are you do you deal with dry skin? Do you have oily skin? Do you deal with acne? What and and if they select yes, then it's like, do you want to add this specific you know, moisturizing treatment? And so it kinda upsells them, gets them to for the correct appointment, and just makes it a lot simpler and really quick to do. Then we're just more like, what is like, we're built for spas. Like, we are specific to the beauty industry. So it's very intentional. Just like with every feature that we have, that it's it's built in mind of you and what what saves you time, what makes you more money, like, what is is easy as possible. And so, basically, I I what I do I do, like, a 20 to 30 minute screen share with a coworker of mine. And we just kind of show you current customers, talk more about your business, get to know you a little bit more. And and show you Manglement, see if it's possibly a good fit. It's more educational. It's not like a hard sell or anything. Just to kinda show you what else is out there, so you can kinda have a comparison. Do you have any time to do that tomorrow or possibly on Friday? Okay. Okay."

I'm actually pretty open. During that time spot. 10:30? Okay. Perfect. And let's see. I can do a you do, like, a 10:15? Okay. Okay. Perfect. Alright. I'm gonna email that over. The email that I have it's christina at your website URL. Is that the 1? Okay. Perfect. Okay. Perfect. And then I'm gonna send over a trial account. It's completely free. You have to put a card or any of your information in. It's just that you can go into the software kinda play around with it. It's in demo mode, so it has, like, fake clients and fake credit cards. So it's kinda fun to, like, just be a little bit more hands on. If you have time to look at it, that's amazing. If not, totally fine. I just like to have it there just in case you wanna take a look at it. So I'll send that over, and then I will see you on Monday. I'll follow-up like, a little like, maybe an hour before just to make sure that time still works for you. And is this a good phone number to reach you at? Okay. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Awesome. Well, I will see you then. I also just barely submitted a request to send you another gift. So don't know if it'll get there by the time we meet, but it might be a couple days following. That it will get delivered. Okay. K. Awesome. Thank you so much. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Have a good 1. Bye bye."

Mean, there's not much you can do when that's happening. And you, like you said, thought it was your Wi Fi, but it was unfortunately the software. So that's just really scary. I'm sorry that that happened. I did wanna let you know that at Mango from I've been here for 1 year, and I've honestly never heard of us going down. I've never seen it go down. We don't have any glitches like that, which is really great. We also have a really great support team that, helps and handles and answers, like, all questions and everything for you, which is awesome too. And then I did wanna let you know, I know you just signed with ADP, but we offer payroll within Vagomit. For only $50 a month plus $8 for each service provider, but we provide it ourselves So everything is within 1 company. So we offer, like, payroll, marketing, POS for credit card processing, online booking, all of that within MangoMint. I would love to. I know you said you chatted with somebody else recently, and it kind of wasn't suitable for you. We obviously offer memberships and packages and all of that too that I did see you currently offer. I was curious if you had any time maybe, like, tomorrow or early next week where I can send you an invite for 20, 25 minutes. We can hop on the demo screen share and actually walk you through what our payroll looks like, our online booking, just show you what Mango Mint has to offer in comparison to Square and Boulevard that you're used to. 1 thing that I can tell you that makes it a lot easier with us is we have any log in or password for your clients in order to book an appointment. So that allows for a lot of rebookings and a lot of new clients to book appointments because they don't need to, like, create a profile. So it's really easy for clients to be able to, like, book their appointment and still have the history and all of that saved. Is there maybe a good day we can connect and, like, walk you through and just chat some more?"

If you need to shift the time at all, no problem. Just let me know, we can find a new time. But for now, we're gonna aim for 01:00 on Tuesday."

If you are wanting to use our messages, that's an extra $50. So, honestly, it would come out to around the 300 as well. But I know our system looks a little bit different, and our features and tools are, they look different than Boulevard as well. So, I'm gonna send you an email with the breakdown of that cost. And, just so you know, like, what it is off the top of your head before we chat. And then I'm gonna send you exactly what can be transferred from Boulevard also. And then at least once you see the demo, you can see if the value and even though if the pricing is somewhat the same, if we can sell save you even a few more dollars or just get more bookings in for you because our system is easier for clients to book, then maybe you'll see the value in it. But I'll just send that over for you anyway, and then we can reconnect on it on the demo for sure on Tuesday. Perfect. And then I wanted to tell you real I'm gonna send this in the email, but I pulled up while we were talking. What can be transferred from Boulevard. So all of this is from our account from our onboarding team. So it looks like client and marketing all account balances, gift card, products, any services, like the of the services and description, sales history, any staff information, future appointments, appointment history, appointment notes, and product purchase history can all be migrated over."

So you'll still be using Boulevard Clients can book on Boulevard, and then the next day, all of a sudden, we can send out, like, a campaign saying, hey. You can book on Mango Mint now. And it's honestly however fast you're able to work with us. So let's say, like, on Tuesday, you're like, oh my god. I love what I'm seeing. This is awesome. Let's get going. We can set the next meeting for onboarding just so you can meet with onboarding and make sure they get all your password and all of that to migrate everything over. If, let's say, you set that meeting for Thursday, then by, like, let's say Monday, you'll be up and running. So however fast you work with us, our team is really great at being able to get you in and get everything converted however fast you'd like. Yeah."

But with Boulevard, it it it is actually actually really easy for us to do the import.

        "text": "Another really cool thing that people have moved that I've heard of why they moved over to us is because of our flows feature, it's targeted marketing, basically, where it reaches out to clients for you. It's automated. And it's, like, based off of their service history and purchase history. So if somebody's come in for an acne facial, say that, and you offer a acne series for it and they didn't purchase the package, it will actually reach out to them, prompting them to purchase the package or to even just rebook for the next one in the series. So it really helps with getting more reoccurring revenue with, like, memberships and packages. One customer that I worked with, they actually had, like, an average of, like, $200 per service ticket, and they had, like, close to, like, 30 new clients come in and sign up for memberships, which, like, was, like, $10,000 in revenue. So and that's why we are a premium software. And and so we are more expensive, but we have a larger return on your investment. So you're paying more upfront, but then you're having a better experience as well as having more revenue coming in. But, I mean, I would love to show you just to see if if it could potentially be a good fit. Just show you, like, current customers of ours, kinda talk more about your business, and just see, you know, if mangomint is, like, a good fit, if it makes sense. If not, like, totally fine. But it just takes about twenty, thirty minutes, and I do it with my coworker. Do you have time possibly later today or tomorrow?"

So you're because it's targeted, so you're not blasting, like, running campaigns. You can run campaigns, but the flow specifically is targeted. So, you know, it'll send it to, like, 40 people, and you have a higher chance on them actually booking their next appointment because it's, you know, personalized to them and and what they like.

And it's quite a few credits, so it'll last you, like, a decent amount of time. So you can test it out, see if it sounds right. We don't do contracts either. We're month to month, so you can always, like, go up a tier, move down a tier. You know, we only have three add ons. That's another huge difference between us and Vagaro,"

And people are a little bit more so alarmed and, like, in the transition process because they'll find something they like, like you said, and then they're like, excited. And then it's not working out in the end. But I did wanna let you know. So every every, like, software out there, so, like, Meevo versus us, they're able to pull like, you said, like, their onboarding team and, like, their back end import team and stuff. They're able to pull certain amount of things from different, like, softwares out there. I just pulled up our imports guide to see from Vagaro what we are able to pull over because Vagaro and Square are the top 2 that we actually pull over from. Meevo in general, I hear a lot of, like, issues with the onboarding process. Like, the platform is great, but then onboarding for whatever reason, heard a little bit of nightmare stories. But just wanted to share with you for the Vagaro, so we are able to pull literally everything from Square and Vagaro. From Vagaro, we can pull your clients and marketing, gift card products, appointment deposits, transaction history, sales history, staff, future appointment, SOAP notes, formula notes, client client profile, gift card product services, and, yeah, everything. Like, literally, are the these are the 2 competitors of ours that I know, like, we pull over and, like, everyone's so satisfied that everything smoothly transitions over. So I did wanna read that over for you. I just pulled it up as you were letting Yes. The SOAP notes from a lot of, other softwares when I'm, like, looking at my list right now, I literally don't see SOAP notes in a lot of them. And for Vagaro, it's, like, capitalized and says SOAP notes. Oh my god. Yeah."

So our system is really customizable, and I know we have all the tiers for, like, if you have commissioned employees versus more, like, 10 99 renters, we are able to do all of that for you. I'm gonna find out if we're able to do the split like that. I wanna say, though, honestly, that we are able to do it. And the reason why is because we have something called resources and our resources is something, like, we labeled ourselves. And what it is is that it's like a specific room. So when a client books a service, it'll be booked in that specific room. So what I'm thinking is that what we can do is have the resources be, like, her room And once anyone books that, it's gonna be, like, whether that's the renter part or her employee part. We can set that up so she can get client her own clientele, like, paid to her. Or if it's for both of you guys, then it'll be, like, a split commission. If you get what I'm saying. But I do think that with our resources feature, that that actually might be doable. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to ask you. So I'm gonna note what you just told me about onboarding and the renters and an employee, like, split. I'm gonna know all of that here, and I was curious. I know you're gonna go back from maternity leave tomorrow. But do you think that, like, know it could be, like, towards the end of the week, but do you have any time this week or next week that we can set up, like, a 25, 30 minute demo screen share, walk you through what Mango Mint like, and then, show you some businesses within the area that use Manglement as well, and then we can chat more about the split and show you, like, what the resources looks like."

Is this, a number to text? Okay. Perfect. I'll text you right now so you have my cell phone as well. And then for now, we will aim for Tuesday the third at 12:00. And I'll send over the invite right when we get off this call, and I'll know everything, as well. And I'm just, like, looking forward to connecting with you, learning more about the med spa, and then we can, again, show you our resources and all of our features and stuff. Cool. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. And, also, I was gonna say, be on a lookout when you go back tomorrow. There should be a purple box from Mango Mint. It's a little gift box that has some gummy bears some cute little stickers, an eye sleeping mask in it. So I hope it's somewhere there for you. Yeah. So yeah, of course. No problem. No problem. Yeah. Of course. Of course. I'm so excited to chat with you. I hope you have a great good rest of the week. Thank you. Bye."

So our focus is really on, like, client experience, but then also on the back end having automation set to really save you time. So tasks are a lot quicker, and booking a client is quicker, you know, getting making sure you have credit cards and having the cancellation policy accepted for every client, whether it's online booking or with, like, booking over the phones. So it's something that we're, like, really good at, but we also have, like, connect, which is, like, web chat, two way texting phone calls, and it's unlimited and inside of Mangovind. And so, yeah, I know I know that you're pretty happy with Fresha. The main reason why I was reaching out was just to see if we could just educationally show you mangomint, just kind of as a comparison, see if potentially we could be a good fit. There's no hard sell or anything like that. It's just to, you know, show you current customers, how they use us, and then kinda see if our system would be that type of good fit."

And so, yeah, I I did see I'm pretty sure it's like, the Wix, like, booking platform that you use. And so I was just curious to know you know, how it's working for you, things you like, if there's something you wish that they had. Anything like that. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, Vagaro. Okay. Okay. And how long have you used them for? Okay. Okay. And have you liked it? I mean, if you've used that for long, I would assume that you've enjoyed using their platform."

It's really clean. Our team has, like, specifically designed it for it to be, like, just really easy for clients to see who they're booking with, what availability they have, even get on a wait list but then, like, a huge thing that sets us apart is our service customizations. You could do, like, you know, is your skin really dry? Is your skin, you know, acne prone? Or would you like this extra treatment? That kind of a thing. So it kinda gives your staff a better idea, before they step in the door and also ups sells themselves. And then we don't have logins. So that's also a really huge benefit. So it gets their credit card, creates a profile, has them accept the cancellation. You can even attach a form or have them upload file or, like, photos. As they're checking out so you can see, like, what their current skin is, what their hair inspo is, that kind of a thing. And so, yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's something you would be open to doing. I just do a 20 to 30 minute, like, kind of a screen share demo. Just to and it's with my coworker, and we just kinda walk you through, like, current customers, just kinda give you an idea of of the features that we have in comparison to Vagaro. Just to see like, educationally, if we are a good fit, that kind of a thing, there's no hard sell. It's pretty relaxed. It's just more, like, educational. We just wanna get to know more about you. Would you have any time to do that this week? Okay. Okay. Mhmm."

But it's also like, customers that I have switched because the most customers that we have that move over to MangoMint are typically from Vagaro. So like, the most common thing I hear is even though we are more expensive, like, each feature is so intentional on, like, saving you time having those automation set, but then also, like, getting clients to come back in, getting them to sign up for memberships And it's, like, targeted towards that specific client based off of, like, what services they've had, what products they've purchased, you know, if they filled out a form and they answered something in a certain way, like, then it has automatic marketing to them. So that kind of a thing, or just helps boost And so it's it's really worth every penny because pays for itself, you know, let alone, it doesn't shut down like Vagaro does. So you're not losing those potential clients that would have been booking during that time as well. There's, like, a lot of kinda give and take in different areas. Yeah. Okay. Okay."

I just wanna tell the fact because I'm, like, I'm Mountain Standard Time, So it's just different time zones, and so I don't wanna, like, book it for the wrong time.

So I'm gonna send that over, and then I'll also send you, like, a direct link Thursday morning to be able to join. It's just easier. It's a Google invite, so you can still, like, get on from that Google invite. I just sent the direct link so you know where to click. It just makes it a little bit easier. Sometimes I get so even though I use it all the time, it's even hard for me. So I just like to send it over. And then I'll also send over a trial account. You can just it it's totally free. You don't have to put credit card or anything. It's just in demo mode. So you can kinda play around with it, fake clients, services, staff, and credit cards. So you can kinda see how to use us and kinda differences and mess around with it. So I'll send that. If you have time, great. If not, totally fine. It's just kind of an extra thing that I like to send. But other than that, I will see you on Thursday. Okay? Of course. Of course. Have a good 1. K. Bye."

I'd say the the biggest differentiator with us is the online booking process for clients. So, like, you know, I come to your website. It's nicely branded. I click book now. It redirects me to the Vagaro marketplace. So it just takes away from your page, not branded to you. It also gives, you know, clients the option of finding other businesses through Vagaro. We handle that process differently. So we actually create a widget on your website. So when you go to click book now, we would just pop up as a left hand overlay, never take you away from the site. And then we all we ask is first, last, and phone number in order for people to book. We don't require a username or login at any point. One, just because it's an it's an easier, more seamless process for people, whether it's, you know, they're returning or a new client."

It's an automated marketing tool. So, you know, say, for example, I'm a I'm a repeat customer. You can automate messages to me in order to get me back in the door. So, like, say, I just came in for my tenth visit. I can automatically receive a text message that says, Alex, thank you so much for your for being a valued customer. Today is your tenth visit. Here's a 20% off coupon on your next your next visit. So, yeah, just ways to to easily target the right people that you wanna go after and get your repeat clients coming back in the door. I would love to set up some time maybe later on this week or early next, just like a twenty to thirty minute screen share, kinda walk you through what the booking process looks like with us, get show you what the the back end platform looks like.

The biggest difference between us to Boulevard, even to Vagaro, is our online booking. It's a lot more branded to you as well as we don't have logins. So it still gets all of their information, credit card, has them accept the cancellation policy. But it's just it makes it a lot simpler without a login. Still creates a profile for them. And if they use the same browser, it auto populates the next time they book an appointment, so it's even faster. And so as far as, like, getting people to come back in, getting them to, you know, purchase a package or sign up for a membership, if you if they're due for a root retouch or you typically say with an acne facial, you recommend them coming in every two weeks to get another facial done. Our system is really smart, so it actually can see that and reach out to those customers, prompting them to schedule that next appointment. So we're really just easy to use, but we're also really built for making you more money. Like, that's our mission as a company is to make businesses more profitable. And, I mean, I would love if you're open to it, I would love to show you just a little bit more. It's just educational, where we walk you through current customers of ours, show you their online booking, how they use service customizations, and then kinda dive into, like, your needs and just see what your thoughts are on it, as well as if potentially we could be a good fit. It's about twenty, thirty minutes. Do you have any time tomorrow to do that?"

And I guess what we hear the most is 1 that can be kinda glitchy and tends to to crash every once in a while, which can, you know, you know, damper on the the tape. But I guess the the main differences between us and Vagaro you know, like I said, I've found your website online. Thought it was really nice. Love your branding. When I click click now, it redirects me to a new page, the Vagaro page. And then requires a username and login in order to book. We handle that client booking process differently. So we actually create a widget on your website So you probably have, you know, the same button where it says, you know, schedule with Carrie. Click there. It doesn't redirect you. It would pop up as a left hand overlay on the page. With your logo on top, so it never takes you away from from your website. We also don't require a username or login in order to book. 1, I guess, the main reason would be it's it's just an easier process, especially for someone who has to use Vagaro before. But 2, like, even for those repeat people, they don't have to remember username and login. And our are creating new ones when they forget and becoming duplicates on your end. So I guess that would be the the major difference. And then, just curious, do you just use Vagaro for the booking piece? Because I do say we're an online booking software. We're, a 1 stop shop so we can handle, you know, payroll. Obviously, the the the booking and scheduling, but POS. And then we have some really cool marketing capabilities. Curious to do any marketing through Vagaro too? Okay."

We pair you with an onboarding manager And because we we do it so often that there's a lot of things that we can automatically import very little manual work. So definitely the gift cards. And I'm happy to why don't we do this? I could set up some time, a tentative calendar invite. I can get back to you on everything that we can automatically transfer from Vagaro. And if it doesn't if there are things in there that is you know you'd sent thousands of gift cards. If that's something we can't automatically import, we'd be happy to, you know, like, move that or or cancel it all together. But I'd love to just, you know, get something tentative. That way, I could have 1 of my product experts on the call. I'll get back to you with the the gift cards for booth renters, and then everything that we can automatically import from Vagaro.

Just to share a little bit more about Mangomint, so we are a salon and spa booking software. We have, like, full customization for you and your staff. Everyone would get their own login, and they can actually check their clients in and out from their phones, if they are wanting to. I mean, if it makes things faster for them, they can collect payments through their phones as well. If you want their bank accounts linked to mangomint, we can have each individual bank account linked. If you want everyone, to have the money go into, like, your bank account and you pay them out, we have ability for commission tiers and, like, all of that. So it calculates it all in the end for you, so you don't have to manually go in to do any of that. We wanna make things as, like, smooth and easy for you as possible."

I won't take too much of your time. Let me know if you do have to go. But I appreciate you chatting with me. And like I mentioned, yesterday, love your branding. Love the logo, all of that. I'm actually from Irvine, so I'm, like, not too far from you guys, but I live in LA now. But would love to come in and even, like, introduce myself if you're open to something like that and give you guys business because you look like such an awesome spa.

I was just curious, like, what what was, hindering you from using it, which but it makes sense that, like, if if your setup was already the way that it was with the previous, but now it's Clover, then you just kind of, like, went with that. Out of curiosity, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. For sure. Out of curiosity, are you using Clover for your POS as well, like, credit card processing, or who are you using for that? You're using Meevo. Okay. Good. They have Meevo Pay. I know they have that, so I was just curious. Okay. Cool. That is all really great information. So to reiterate what you just mentioned to me, we are a all in 1 solution, and we wanna be, like, your 1 stop shop. We don't want you to pay mail Mailchimp or Clover or anybody else We want you to use, like, Mingle Mint just to make everything, like, integrated and super simple for you and to also just, like, have you know exactly what you're paying for and you're just paying, like, 1 company. You know? We offer everything from, like, online booking. We support multi location. We offer packages, memberships. We have our own POS system. And payroll team as well. So if you are needing payroll, we offer that. We offer marketing. We have text message and email. Notifications for all your clientele when they book appointments. 1 thing I heard you say multiple times is the ease of use. And also that clients sometimes call in to make an appointment because it's just easier for them to call or they're used to that or it's a little harder for them to, log in and book on Meevo. With Mangomint, we are, like, super, super simple to use. No login or password needed. We wanna make things as easy and simple for your clients. So everything is cloud based, but all they have to do is literally plug in their first name, last name, email, and phone number, and it pulls forward their account, has everything saved in there. They never need to log in with password or username in order to book an appointment. So, this allows for a lot of rebookings and a lot of new clients to book because they don't have to ever create, like, a username, which a lot of people don't like doing because have so many passwords already, in life. So I'm like, I don't want a password for, like, making a hair appointment or a spa appointment also. You know? It's just not as convenient. So we make that as easy as possible for you.

So if you want it for specific services, or for all services booked, no problem. We have the full customization to be able to have them add their credit card info, and that won't pop up cloud based as they're signing in obvious not signing in, but as they're booking. But, like, on it's in the system and in their profile. So once they put their card in once, it'll always be there so they don't you have to necessarily ask for it again."

With with our membership too, it's really, really super easy to use. It I would love to, like, show you a demo and, like, what our membership looks like and some spas in, like, Newport, New and Irvine and Orange County area that do use us and what their setup kind of looks like. We can walk you through and show you how their memberships are and, like, what their online booking is as well. But we can support that and eliminate the, like, Clover that you're using. I do think that you'll find ours to be, like, really simple and easy to use. So I would love to show you that on a demo. And then I wanted to tell you, did you mention anything else Yes. You are able to check clients in and out as well, so that's no problem. Which is great. And then, yeah, we just make everything as easy as possible for you and your staff, and your clients."

It's every single card. Yeah. That's weird. I wonder why with Discover. I've been hearing that more. They're like, nope. You can't use that card here. I think it did too.

Cool. So the way our payroll works is it's just like an add on So it's a flat rate of $50 a month. And then it's $8 extra per worker. So if you have, like, 5 of you, then it's $50 plus I don't know to do math. 5 times 8 is 40, so $90. Per month to run payroll as many times as you would like per month."

        "text": "Oh, okay. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. I've seen a couple of people. Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean, Mango Mint we work really well with hybrid salons and spas. We work really well with booth renter models as well. So you basically have 1 account and then they have subaccounts in a sense. So they get their own merchant counts, They they handle all of that themselves. It just gives everyone access to like, a more premium software, as well as I've seen some people. It kinda depends because we have so many companies that have booth rent. Booth renters. So some of them will open up their online booking, and so it will show each of the booth renters there as well as their commission. So it's kind of a unique setup. So it's really like, what will work for you kind of a thing that you will customize. But, yeah, I mean, we are more of a premium We have a lot more automations just set up to get people to come back in, even purchase, like, packages if somebody came in for an acne series of facials, and they only did 1 and you typically offer them to do or tell them to do 4, you can say, hey, you came in for this facial. How did you like it? And then if they, you know, give you a good rating, then it will send them something saying, hey. Thank you so much. You should purchase this package. It is actually, like, cheaper. We're discounting each service by this or whatever. So you can kinda, like, customize that as well, and that's what's another thing that's kinda unique about us. We have a lot of differences between us and GlossGenius and even us and Booker. And so, like, what I do, I do like, it's a 20 to 30 minute screen share with my coworker and I. And we just kinda like a demo. But more so to just show you our current customers, learn more about your needs, and then kinda show you how that works with Manglement as well as kind of how that looks with booth renters with suite. Owners as well. So I don't know if that's something that you'd open to be to do. It's it's pretty low key. It's just more educational. If it's a fit, then it's awesome. If not, that's totally fine."

I think that we might be bigger as well. I haven't looked at Goldie's so I could be totally wrong. But as far as, like, our system goes, so we have a we have a flows fee where you can set it up of, hey. It's been, you know, 2 weeks since your last lash fill. You're due for another fill, send them a text message to get them to rebook, that kind of a thing. Very similar to Goldie. It's all automated, though. And so you can use that, like, on on the back end. You can also do that. It's their tenth visit, and the system can automatically see that. You can give them a discount code for their tenth visit or give them a client account balance of, like, $15 or whatever it is. Just saying, hey. We appreciate you. Use that on your next visit kind of a thing. So we do all of that. But it's very customizable. So you can kind of create these automations We have an entire team that you can sit with and and tell them any ideas that you have of of how you wanna use the automations. And they can help build all of those out for you. I even have people that use it for they have a acne series. So typically, it's, like, 4 facials with the acne line. And so and they recommend them to come in every 4 weeks, so they can see the lasting results of that. And so then if and it's a package that people buy the series in and if they come in for an acne facial and they didn't purchase a package, the system can see that and actually targets them. In, like, a respectful way, of course. But just saying, hey, purchase a package. We see that you came for an acne facial. This would be a really good fit for you. You actually save money. So it gets more people buying memberships you know, packages, that kind of thing get more reoccurring revenue."

        "text": "Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Yeah. I mean, we have we're more I guess, we're we're just different. Our system like, we have fully integrated forms and image uploading. So when somebody books an appointment, they don't have a login. We don't have logins. But it can actually have them so they put their credit card in. Accept the cancellation policy, and then it has them upload current photos or inspiration photos right there. You can have it. And then saves to their profile. So their client timeline, you can see all of the photos that they've ever uploaded. Also, your service providers if they ever take a picture, they can upload it and just save it directly in there. So it's an easy way to track progress as well. And then on top of that, we have fully integrated forms. So say that it's a new client, intake form, so it could the system can see that that's a brand new client, send them that form. As well as say that they're going to be getting a a HydraFacial. And you have another form for that. So send them the form It'll keep reminding them until they're completed. And then if they haven't completed them by the time they come in, you can actually just send it over to an iPad really easily and have them quickly fill it out. And then it saves to their profile. So and then, yeah. So we're just kind of a little different. I I would love to what I do is I just do, like, a 20, 30 minute screen share, kind of like a demo, just to show you current customers of ours, what their online booking looks like, how they use our service customizations. And then kinda just with everything that you've told me, just show you how that kinda works with Manglement. Just more educational to show you what else is out there. Just to potentially see if we could be a good fit. And it's just a a virtual meeting that we do. Would you have any time for that, later this week?"

I'll also send over a trial account It's in demo mode. Totally optional for you. But it's just kinda there to play around with. It has fake clients, like, fake, like, credit cards, that kind of a thing. So you can book appointments, see what the text messages look like. That kind of a thing. It just kinda gives you a little bit of a deeper dive into our software. So I'll send that over. If you have time, great. If not, totally fine. It just says a little extra thing there for you. But other than that, I will follow-up with you Friday morning. Just to confirm that time, and then we'll go from there. K. Okay. Yes. Yeah. I totally get it. I have a a almost 6 year old and a 2 and a half year old. So I get it. Like yes. Wife is a little crazy. It's a little bit much. K. Of course. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. I will k. Have a good 1. Okay.

Our, like, standard plan is $2.45 a month. And that's for up to 20 service providers. And you get literally all of our, features and tools included in that. So, like, online booking, each of you would be able to manage, of course, your own schedule, full customization, inventory egift cards, reporting, packages, memberships, a full weight room, We're HIPAA compliant as well. We have, like, everything under the sun. And then we also offer marketing, and then we also offer our own, like, POS system, which our rates are 2.45% plus 15¢. So I'm not sure how much boulevards is. But the 2 45 includes all of that. If you are needing any, like, forms and charting, it would cost an extra just $50 a month. At most, like, literally, at most, you would be paying maybe $3.50 ish 400. But if even that, it would be around 3 with with us. Would you be open to maybe scheduling a time whenever you have, like, 25, 30 minutes just to check out, like, a demo and chat more about how you guys are using Boulevard, and we can walk you through, like, what our features and tools look like. So you can at least compare them to Boulevard, and we can send you that recording as well. And set you up, like, with a free trial so you can, like, deep dive in on your own time as well."

And we don't have logins, so it still gets you know, credit card, has them accept the cancellation, even you can have them fill out a form that attaches to their profile, and you can have as many forms and attach them to different services. And we also do, like, image markup, as well as, like, internal marketing to get people to come back in if they say that they've had a laser service, typically, you offer it in, like, a series to have better results. So the system will automatically reach out to them saying, hey, you're due for your next 1 or actually purchase this package. And you can set it up. However, that's just a random example. But, yeah, I wanted to touch base. I did see that you were using Square. I just kinda get an idea of how it's working for you guys. If there's things that you really like about them or wish that they had that they don't currently have or works a little bit better, that kind of a thing."

I guess the main thing that I hear from people that do switch from GlossGenius to Manglement is that it was more designed for solo providers. So, like, it does really good with solos. But kinda struggles with with larger salons and when you're you're looking to grow. And then I I guess the the biggest differentiator with GlossGenius and Manglement is, like, you have a nice, like, branded website But then when I go to book, it brings me to a separate page. Price, username, and login in order to book an appointment. We handle the booking process a little differently. We create a on your website. So we just pop up as a left hand overlay. Just require first name, last name, and phone number in order to book. We do that for a couple reasons. I guess, mainly because it's just easier for the client And then easier for you because not sure how GlossGenius handles this, but we hear a lot of times when people are required to create a username and a password, when they forget it, it creates duplicates in their system. So yeah. And then curious I say that we're an online booking software. We're, like you said, we're we're a 1 stop shop. We handle, you know, like, POS, obviously, the scheduling and and booking, but also payroll. And then we have lot of really cool marketing features I'm curious. Do you do any marketing through GlossGenius? Okay. Sure. Like, the use mass email blast? Okay. Cool. Yeah. We we can handle the email blast as well. We make it more targeted too so, like, you could filter those lists down to, like, you know, people do who don't have a an appointment on the books at the moment. Or people have only booked at the certain type of appointment. Just ways to, like, narrow that down. It sounds like you've you've been with for a while, and it's it's worked well on us. But I'd love to sit down with you for, like, 20 to 30 minutes. Do a screen share. A tour of the platform, kinda show you how we stack up and how we handle things differently than GlossGenius. I have my calendar open here. Is there a day, maybe tomorrow or next week, that might work for you? Oh, good. Good."

So our focus is on client experience, just making sure it's as easy, clean as possible. One thing that sets us apart is our online booking. We don't have logins, so it it's very clean. It's branded to you. You can add service customizations too of, like, skin types do you have or how long is your hair. Is your hair thicker? Do we need to add extra time? Or do you wanna do an extra treatment? Do you wanna add this add on? So just kinda helps clients do that before they even set foot in the salon, and then books out the proper amount of time for your service providers. We do so, so, so much more than that.

We're an online booking software for spas, and actually sent you a little care package in the mail. Found your website online. Thought it was really nice and wanted to send you a little something to say hello. Do you remember seeing that?"

So we've gotten really good. I know you said that it it's kind of a pain to switch softwares. We have onboarding managers that do that every single day. As far as, you know, transferring over information. I would say that the the 2 biggest things that set us apart from Vagaro are are 1 customer service. And 2 is is ease of use. So yeah. You have a beautiful website, but when I go to click now, I know it takes you away from the site, brings you Vagaro, requires the username and login in order to book. We handle the booking process a little differently where we we create a widget on your website we would just pop up as a left hand overlay on the website. Don't require username or login in order for your clients to book. For a couple reasons. 1, it's just easier for them. Don't have to remember a username or password. Like, for me, if it's if it was the spa and I'm only coming in once every 6 6 months, I might not remember my password. So easier for them, but also better for you because it doesn't create duplicates on your end. So, like, if I go in and create another 1, you'll have you'll have 2 of me in the system. Yeah. But I are you just using Vagaro for the booking piece? I I say we're an online booking software. We're really, like, a 1 stop shop, so we handle obviously, like, the booking and the scheduling. Also, POS we we handle payroll as well. We have a lot of really cool marketing features. Do you do any marketing through Vagaro? Yeah."

        "text": "Yeah. Right. Yeah. Sure. I I I hear you. No. We I when to be transparent with you, we do charge for marketing to a la carte. So it's, like, on a credit based system. But we so we can handle, the text and email blast, but get a little more granular, like, say, you could narrow that list down instead of just blasting it to every single client that's ever come in. You could you could filter it out, say, like, only send this to people who haven't don't have an appointment on the books or only only send to people who've booked this appointment. And then we also have, you know, really cool automated text features to just get those those clients coming back in the door. I'm not sure if you offer packages or memberships. But, like, say, for instance oh, okay. I got it. Yeah. Just smart automated ways, and we actually offer 5,000 marketing credits if you do end up joining. So it's a good way to, like, trial See if there you get a return on investment and, you know, if it if it's not working, then you then you don't buy another bundle of marketing. But I I I threw a lot of information at you. I would love to set up some time, like, maybe 20 to 30 minutes to do a screen share. I'll walk you through the platform, give you a tour, show you how we do things differently from Vagaro, And Then If Everything Looks Good, We Could Discuss, Like, What Onboarding Would Look Like What We're Able To Bring Over From Vagaro. And if it's not something you're ready to do right now, at least, you know, we're out there for, you know, down the road. If it's something you wanna explore. But is do you have any availability maybe tomorrow or Thursday?"

Phenomenal about is our, like, our charting, our image markup, our forms, the way our online booking is set up, it's so clean and beautiful. And we don't have logins, so it makes it super easy for clients to book appointments. And so yeah. So I just sent that over. That's kind of a little bit about Mango Mint.

Also, another 1 that I hear a lot is Square. We've had actually quite a few just move over to us because we're more built for kind of, like, the med spa world. And just, like, getting people to come back in for you. Say that they get, like, a laser treatment or a high hydro facial, typically, you recommend, like, multiple of those services. So getting them saying, hey. You're it's you're due for your next 1 or purchase a package you know, sign up for a membership to get more reagree clients and revenue coming in. That's something that, like, our system takes care of, like, on the back end. It's a really easy and simple setup for it, but it just kind of has that type of contact for you, so you don't have to text people being like, hey. It's been 6 weeks since I last saw you. Do you wanna rebook? Or what's going on? You know? You don't want it to take up your time.

And so that's something we can kinda dive into. We are more expensive, but the thing about our software and personally that I've seen using it, like, personal experience, is that it pays for itself. The amount the amount of more people I get coming back in, the more booking I get because it is so easy to book. There's no glitches, and it's you know, also great because people can, like, upsell themselves before they even walk in. With, like, service customizations. So even though we are a expensive, I totally get that. It pays for itself, and it's just an absolutely incredible software. But it's just worth looking into.

        "text": "Yeah. No. Yeah. I do hear a lot of good things about Vagaro. I'd say the biggest differentiator with us and Vagaro, and Vagaro is actually the number one software we pull people from, is a lot of clients don't love the booking experience with Vagaro. So, like, Vagaro, it redirects me away from your page and your your beautifully branded site, Requires a username and password in order to log in. How we handle that is we we make it even more user friendly than Vagaro. We just create a a pop up as a widget on the left side of your site. Never takes users off the site. All it asks in order to book is first, last name, and then either email or phone number. It'll automatically recognize someone if they're a repeat customer. But, yeah, it doesn't require a username or login. That way, it it eliminates the possibility of, like, someone forgetting their password and creating a duplicate on your end. So easier for the spa, easier for the client. And then I I say that we're a booking software, but we're really like a one stop shop. So we handle, you know, of course, the booking and scheduling, but also, the processing payments, payroll. We have a lot of really cool marketing features too to handle forms and charting. Curious. Do you do any marketing through Vagaro?"

So able to get a little smarter than just, like, those mass email and text blasts. They also have what we call flows. It's a really cool automated marketing tool, automates text messages to go out. So say I'm someone who just came in for my tenth visit, will automate automatically send me a text message. Hey. Thanks for coming in. This is your tenth visit. Why don't you buy a membership? So I saw that you had, you know, memberships available on your site. So, yeah, just smarter ways to, like, automate the marketing and get your repeat customers coming back in the door, you know, getting those ticket prices up and that sort of thing."

So what Mango Mint is, just like a side by side comparison, we have been around since 2017. We are an all in 1 solution, so everything that I list is included in the package that you get. We are month to month. And it's just a more modern solution since we are a bit newer. It's a little bit easier on the eyes. It's not as clunky just as, like, feedback that I've heard from personal people.

We have 3 tiers for our monthly subscription starting at $1.65. The only thing that would make it go up is just the number of service providers that you have. After that, our credit card processing fees are actually pretty competitive So we have 2 types of fees. We have an in person transaction fee. So if the card's in their hand and they're physically swiping it, that's 2.45. For virtual transactions, anything that's, like, booked over the phone or the memberships or anything like that, that's 2.9. Mhmm."

It's more of, like, a if you were interested, a lot of this stuff that we have built and why the sticker price looks the way it is is because it's really meant to help enhance the business to get past the maintenance and then maintaining with ease of use with add on, online booking, a bunch of other really cool tools. Like I said, I'm not expecting, like, you to sign up today or anything miraculous. This is more just educational for when the time is right for you. Even if it's not now. So what I could do is I if you have, like, 15 to 20 minutes later this week or next week, I could pop on to you with, like, a quick 15 to 20 minute screen share.

A lot, and a lot of a lot of people and salons and businesses that I call in general have been using softwares for quite a few years, but if but some of them are open to just seeing, like, what else is out there, to see if there is anything that would be beneficial to help you guys just even manage, like, your day to day to day or with marketing tools or saving on, like, credit card processing rates and stuff like that. If you are open to it, would love to, like, share more insight on how we do diff differ from Vagaro. 1 main thing is right now when I'm on your website and click book now, it takes me away from your beautiful site and takes me to, like, Vagaro's external page where clients need to book there and, like, have a login and whatnot. Mangomet, we actually have an overlay that would open directly on your website. And we wanna, like, focus on building, like, you and your brand. So we don't have, like, a login or a password or anything either just to make things easy for your clients. And all bookings happen directly on your website, which draws a lot more clicks and, like, clients leading to your website specifically, which is really cool. Would you happen to have some time by any chance? I know I just called out of the blue, but to maybe set up a time to to chat a bit more and learn more about how you guys are using Vagaro and maybe share, a little demo on how Mango Mint compares tool wise and stuff."

And our onboarding team at actually handles that for you. So for now, let's say we have our little demo meeting. You do like what you see. We would then set up another meeting where with the the onboarding manager where you can chat, ask any more questions that you have, and then they would ask you, like, what you want pulled over from Vagaro, if there's some you wanna leave there, if you wanna help with, like, eliminate duplicates and all of that, they can do all that for you.

I'm pretty sure Daysmart allows a lot of the information to be pulled over, and we would do all that for you and help, like, eliminate duplicates and stuff. So then it's like a seamless transition from Daysmart into Mangomint. We won't shut off Daysmart, obviously, until you're on Mangomint.

The nice thing about our software on, like, the calendar is that you can we have, like, smart booking, so it will fill in those gaps. So if somebody books for nine, their, you you know, appointment ends at 09:45, you can put, like, a five, ten minute buffer time in there so it gives the client to set up for their next appointment. Or you don't have to do that, and then the next client can book exactly at 09:45. So that's kind of a cool thing. I would love to give you just a comparison. It's completely educational, and it just like for us to show you current customers of ours and then kinda talk about your business and show you how people use mangomint with similar setups as that you have. We do have quite a few, like, blow dry bars. And then our memberships are absolutely phenomenal. And then, I guess, one other thing that I would wanna show you is our flows feature, which is targeted client marketing. So if somebody has come in and the system can tell that they don't have a membership"

For right now, all of our automations that we have on the back end kinda take control of that. We do have, like, our connect feature, which is two way texting, web chat, and phone calls. So if somebody is on your website and they chat in, you can have automated text messages follow-up with them. Or if you don't answer, it sends a text message and they can start a conversation with somebody. And then it tracks all of the communication across all platforms, connects it to their profile, so it's just easier to book appointments, and also just see different types of conversations that you've had with them in the past.

So less amounts of clicks, to get to where you need to go, that kind of a thing. Another huge difference is our online booking is a lot cleaner It's more branded to you, and we don't have logins. So it's less confusing for clients when booking appointments. It's a lot quicker. And then kind of just, like, the flow of when somebody starts you know, selecting services, who they want to meet with, you know, what time. It's just a really like, seamless kind of flow. So it makes it really for clients. Another huge thing about us, it's been a minute since I've talked to a ton of people about Forest. I haven't really been hearing a lot of a lot of Forest lately. But 1 thing that we have that no other platform has is we have our connect feature, which is our 2 way text web chat, and phone calls, and it's all to Manglement. So if somebody calls in, if somebody texts, if they do go on the website, it puts it into 1 place, and it connects it to their profile. So it's just easier to track everyone you know, all the different communications that they've had, previous conversations, that kind of a thing. So that's really nice. And it's actually less than what I pay for my 1 phone. Line a month. So that's also kind of, like, a bonus. Yeah. And then we have marketing. Our marketing is different than theirs. It's behavior based for your clients. So say that somebody has come in for a root retouch, and they didn't book their next appointment. Say it's been 4 weeks since their last time coming in. An automated text message. Like, the system's just smart enough to see And then we'll send them a text message saying, hey. Rebook your appointment. It's coming up. That kind of a thing. So it it's kind of up to kinda to your needs We have a ton of features. So I'm like, I can go on and on and on. About differences. We're just very different. At the end of the day than them. I would love to just schedule some time with you and your daughter just to show you it's not, like, to get you guys to sign up right then and there, but it's just really to show you current customers of ours and just our differences kinda dive into your needs, and then show you that on Mango Mint. Do you have any time next week to do that? Okay."

And then, it's nice because if you do run into anything, we can answer any questions as well. That you have there, or just how to use it in general. And then other than that, if you do have any questions, you can always text me or send an email back to the email. I'm gonna send you.

You get assigned to your own onboarding manager, and they really take the reins with getting that moved over. Typically, we see 5 to 7 working days. Sometimes it's quicker than that. It also just kinda depends on your timeline. And when you know, what you're looking at, you know, that kind of a thing. It's really up to you. And then the onboarding manager really helps with, like, implementation, so getting staff set up, making sure that you know, their commissions are correct and service amounts are correct and and everything like that.

We have a lot of really cool ways to work with our resources and kinda set it up so it just makes your life easier. I do like it's like a twenty, thirty minute screen share. It's just educational just to kinda give you an idea of, like, how our current customers use us, kinda dive into, like, your needs, kinda show you how that setup would look like in mangomint."

We're a little bit easier to use. We have, like, a feature called connect. So it's web chat, two way texting, and phone calls built into the system and connects client profiles, that kind of a thing.

And then as long as, like, you have the app downloaded on your phone or if it's another employee, multiple employees, they can turn off, like, accepting calls that day or whatever however you would like to do it. So it's actually pretty cool how, like, we do have that set up, but it's also nice that it's just connected to the system. So, like, it will pop up that person's profile, and then you can just quickly book an appointment. But then we also have express booking too. So say that somebody does call in and it's a new client, you can just send them a text message and it gets their credit card info and have them accept the cancellation. So it just is, like, a lot quicker and easier. But liability wise, you're getting covered on both ends of getting that credit card and having them accept it. So you don't have to deal with, like, chargebacks and that kind of a thing. Well, our team actually takes care of if you do get chargebacks. But, yeah. So what is your schedule looking like? It's about twenty, thirty minutes. I bring in my coworker, and we just kind of walk you through it, show you current customers of ours, kinda talk about your needs and what you're looking for, and then kinda show you, you know, like, the most important things. Do you have a good day"

So they're the same server that does, like, Amazon, which if you've ever shopped at Amazon, tends to be a little bit reliable. Not their delivery service because I've noticed Prime is no longer Prime when it says two day, but as far as, like, actually their platform where you can go and online shop. So the same thing with us. We very rarely go down as far as crashes. Actually, in the time I've been here, I haven't had that experience personally of us going down. So just a little bit of reassurance on that end. Something that kind of makes us stand out from Vagaro as far as bookings, specifically with online booking, is we don't require logins. So with Vagaro, you'll notice that the clients are required to have a login for a password, and they have to do that in order to book their appointment. We noticed and we had a lot of people come to us, from other softwares that have that feature as well where they lost a couple people who might have possibly booked, but it was just a little bit too complicated. They didn't wanna remember those logins. So we decided just to x nay that part to streamline the online booking a little bit more. So what happens, Katie, is we actually go onto your website and integrate with them. Is your website hosted by, like, GoDaddy? Is it just something you guys built out yourself?"

We brand it to you guys, so we will make sure to have the logo on there. And then it's pretty much customizable in any way. So for them, it's only clicking a couple of times to book the appointment as opposed to having to worry about the login and then getting taken to, like, a Vagaro site, and it's just getting a little bit clunky and confusing. Yeah. We have reporting that can definitely help. Reporting is something that I would recommend seeing just because everybody has a way that they like to have reporting. Is there any specific reports that you just absolutely have to have?"

I know Vagaro is a little bit on the older side, so it tends to look like no disrespect because it is actually a really great software. I do I do like it. But it tends to give Excel vibes a little bit in how it looks, so it's harder to it's harder to read for people who are in this industry who crave visuals. Anything else other than booking?

If you have someone that just, like, walks in through a door, you can check them out right there on the spot if they bought a product, either linking it to account or not depending on what you prefer. And then, obviously, checking out, like, actual transactions is a pretty easy and streamlined process. We'd like to simplify it as much as possible, then you can have people pay. I'm so sorry. I have, like, four shots a day quill into the day. So if I'm stumbling on my words, I apologize. But with checking out, it's super streamlined, and you can choose different ways for them to pay. You can actually customize it, like, if people pay through Venmo or they have other methods of payments, CareCredit, all of that fun stuff, we can make it however you need it to be. I didn't know if you were interested because it's easy for me to say, like, yeah. We have it, and then it's a whole another ballgame for you to actually, like, see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you had, like, fifteen to twenty minutes sometime either tomorrow or later next week, you and I could sit down and do, like, a quick screen share. And then after that screen share, we actually do free trials. So that way during the screen share, we can explain mangomint to you guys, and then you have an understanding of it, and then you can go play with it before you make any decisions."

There are going to be some things that, like, you may have to, like, tweak on hand. But what we can do is clients and marketing gift cards, products, appointment deposits, transaction history, so that all the sales histories, staff, future appointments, self notes, formula notes, client client profile notes, a bunch of other stuff. So we do a lot of that for you. We have a whole team dedicated. Usually, the onboard process takes on average about a week for you to even just have to transfer. So it's, like, a really quick process for people to do, and then we have a whole team that we kind of, like, white glove it, and they'll walk you through that process so it's not confusing. Of course."

So I just wanted to show some love. Have you ever heard of, like, mangomint before? Okay. Okay. So mangomint, we are a modern all in one platform. So I don't know if you've heard of Boulevard. We're kind of similar to Boulevard. We're a little bit more affordable, and we're just easier to use, and we have a bunch of features that they don't have. But I did see that you were using GlossGenius. I was just curious to know, you know, what your experience has been like. Do you like all of the features that they have? Do you feel like because I did see that you have, like, about 11 service providers. And I know that, like, at a larger scale, typically, people kinda grow out of Gloss. And so I was just wondering, you know, how it's working for you and how that's been going."

A lot of people would just keep their account open with them, remove all of their providers so they're paying less each month, but then continue to pay down the loan. It won't qualify you to get because, you know, you know how that works of, like, your cost so much, they offer you this much. That so, like, you don't get, like, that loan anymore, but you can still, like, you know, pay pay that loan down. And then you just switch over to mangomint, And then you start using mangomint as your platform, but just have like, finish out your loan. Our we are white, like, white labeled our processor is white labeled Stripe. So, Stripe is, like, our processor. I don't know. It's something that we have to take a look at. Like, we don't do loans or anything like that, so it's probably through Gloss. But that's what people typically do. What I would love to do also is I just do, like it's a screen share kind of like a demo. It's less, like, formal. It's more so I'm showing you, like, current customers of ours. I'm talking about your business, your needs, and then showing you a little bit more about mangomint, what our customers do, where they, how they use us to get more clients booking, getting people coming back in, getting them to spend more money, that kind of a thing, or whatever is most important to you.

It's branded to you, and it's very clean. It's very easy to add, like, service customization. So when people do book, they can actually just upsell themselves before they even step foot in the salon, and it also books out the proper amount of time. That kind of a thing just saves you a lot of heartache, but higher ticket service services coming through. And then we don't have logins. So it if somebody's already booked an appointment, typically, it just auto populates their information again so they don't have to, like, fill out their email and stuff.

I just wanted to give you context of, like like, who I am, who mangomint is, why we sent the gift, that kind of a thing. I'm do you have a minute? Okay. So yeah. So my name is Kylie. I work for mangomint. I'm also a salon owner. They kinda gave me free rein to find, like, really awesome spas and to send a gift out just to show, like, a little bit of love and support. Personally, like, I know how hard it is creating a business, keeping it running, managing employees, all of that. It's a lot of work. And so, yeah, I just wanted to show a little bit of that support. I looking at your website right now, you have, like, absolutely incredible branding. I see that you only have, like, book online for events. What are you using? Are you just using Wix for that?"

Okay. So, like, as far as mangomint goes, we're a lot more of, like, a modern all in one platform. So, as far as, like, our interface goes for online booking, it's absolutely phenomenal. Like, stunning. It's it's very clean. It's very sleek. It makes it really easy for clients to book appointments. Also, on, like, service customizations. If that if you wanna clarify, you know, what pressure they want their massage or if you have additional add ons, it's really easy for them to add those on. And it really helps just, I guess, upsell themselves before they even step foot into the spa, which is really nice because it books out the proper amount of time. You're getting more money out of the service as well, that kind of a thing. But we don't have logins. So it still gets their credit card, has them accept the cancellation policy. You can even have them fill out a form as well right then and there. But it just makes it really quick. And you it could take, like, twenty seconds to book an appointment, which actually a lot of, like, our customers that have moved over to us, they've seen, like, a pretty big increase with bookings. What I do is just, a twenty, thirty minute screen share. It's kind of like a demo, but it's more so just to show you current customers of ours, what their online booking looks like, how they, like, in different unique ways, use us. But then really just dive into, like, your needs, just show you our platform as a whole, and and see if potentially we would be a good fit. There's no hard sell or anything. It's just educational. Do you have any time possibly today or tomorrow to do that?"

And it's just like a link to join because we just do it over, like, a screen share just so we can actually show you our screen, show you the software, all of that. One other thing I'm gonna send over, it's a trial account. It's in demo mode. It has, like, fake clients, fake credit cards, that kind of thing. It just allows you to go in there, kinda play around with it. I am like, being in the beauty industry myself, I like to, like, very be like, very much so be, like, hands on, and I'm a visual learner. And so I just like to have that there just so you can get, like, another view of mangomint yourself. If you have time to look at it, amazing. If not, that is totally fine. I know that you're really busy because we'll kinda walk you through it anyways. But I just like to send that over just as, a little extra. And then is this a good phone number to text you at? Okay. Okay. Perfect. I'll send you over a text message from my personal cell. That way, and I'll also loop in my coworker. They're, like, a product specialist. They work they've worked with hundreds, if not thousands of people. And so they just are really in the know with how to use our software, what other people are doing. So I'm gonna loop them into that message as well just to, like, make a little introduction. But if you have any questions, that's, like, an incredible place to just shoot them over because they can quickly, like, answer them because they kinda know everything. I I know a lot. Don't get me wrong. I know a lot, but not quite not quite at their level. So I just like to loop them in as well. So yeah. So I'll follow-up with you probably Thursday afternoon just to confirm that time still works. But other than that, do you have any other questions for me? Anything that's top of mind?"

And then we only and then you also can do logins for, like, front desk people just for you and your partner, that kind of a thing as well. And then you can actually customize what type of access your employees have. So can they change things? Are they allowed to book for themselves? Do they, you know, do they have, you know, different customizations as far as that goes? So you do have quite a bit of control. Yeah. Or can they block off time themselves? Or is that something that they need to go through you to do? That kind of a thing. That that is up to you as the business owner. So, yeah, it's really it's really easy. It's really simple. When people call over the phone, we do actually have a feature. It's called connect. So it's two way texting, web chat, as well as, as, like, phone calls. And so you can have access. Like, you can give your employees access to be able to answer phones. So if the front desk can't get to it, it it can call multiple people. If somebody's in service all day, you know, they don't have to have the calls go to them, that kind of a thing. So it just kind of streamlines that communication, shows it all in one place, and connects it to their profile. So you can see, like, past history with them as well, which is, like, absolutely phenomenal. We also do have express booking. So when somebody calls in, all you need is their name and their phone number, and it sends them a text message where they finish filling out their info, including a credit card, and accepting that cancellation policy. So liability, you're covered if it's either over the phone that they're booking or online, which is huge for like, for me, that was a huge game changer because I'd had every single person's credit card. I knew every single person had accepted the cancellation policy. So, like, you know, on on at the end of the day yeah. Okay."

And it actually saves so much time over the phones because you guys are busy. You don't have so much time to just put in all their info, and then it might be incorrect. And, you know, taking a credit card over the phone, it's kind of uncomfortable and you know? So, like, it it absolutely amazing. So that's something that we can show you, and we can actually send you a text message while we're on the demo, and you can see what it looks like. Mhmm. Yeah."

It's included in your subscription. And you can kinda just talk about, like, ways that you wanna reach out to your customers, you know, sending those offer codes to specific people, getting people to come back in for another appointment. My favorite is, say, that somebody's come in for three massages and you guys offer a package or have a membership. That's like the bread and butter of the industry, just getting you more revenue. And you can sit down with them, and they can show you how to build these out and and kind of what other customers do, where they've seen success, that type of a thing, and it's completely free. So other than, like, you had to purchase, like, the marketing credits, but to meet with them, have them build that kind of a thing, it's it's part of our system.

Just get a little bit smarter rather than, like, a a mass email blast to everyone. We also have what we call flows, which is an automated tool. So let's just say, for example, I'm a a client of yours. I've been in 10 times for the same service. You can auto automate text messages to me, like something, hey. Notice you came in through your tenth service. Thanks for being a a loyal client. Here's a 10% off discount on your next visit. Or not sure if you do any packages or marketing, but, hey. I noticed you've come in for the same the same appointment this many times. Why don't you buy a package at this rate? So just smarter ways to get those your current client base coming back in the door and to, you know, get those ticket prices up a bit. But I I know that I I threw a lot of information at you. I'd love to set up some time for, a twenty to thirty week free here. I could just give you a tour of our platform, show you how we do things a little differently than Square,"

People could if they're a first time client, sometimes people don't like to call over the phone. Also, it just makes your life easier. We can collect credit card information online. Also, even if people call over the phone, we have a really easy way for you to take their credit card information. Not sure if you'd you charge, like, a deposit or a full payment upon booking. But, yeah, if we have a feature called express booking. So, like, say some I call you on the phone. I say I wanna book an appointment next Tuesday at twelve. Great. We'll see you then. You're gonna receive a text message that's going to prompt you to enter your credit card information. If you don't do that within the half hour, hour, however long you set it, that appointment's gonna fall off the books.

First off, like, our main focus is customer experience. So we want our customers to have the best experience while, you know, navigating the software, making sure it's easy. We wanna save you time. We don't want you to do two transactions just to be able to check out products. That seems absolutely insane and waste a lot of time on your end. And then on, like, clients' end, we want it to be branded to you. We want it to be very clean, but also making it really easy for your clients to book an appointment, to still get all of their credit card info, have them accept a cancellation. But we don't have logins, so they don't need to remember a password. You're not dealing with duplicate accounts on the back end. It's just a really smart system. As far as reminders go, I just wanted to kinda touch quickly on each thing. Reminders, you can have you can set up as many I think it's, like, up to, like, eight reminders before an appointment. You can do text messages. You can customize the text messages. You can do emails. You can do both. It's really up to you. You can set the time parameters as well. So if it's two hours before,"

Typically, if they've purchased it, it attaches to their account. So when they're checking out, it'll show they have a gift card available, as well as people can purchase them online, and they can also purchase them for other people as well. So, they can assign that gift card to somebody else's email. And so when they come when that friend of theirs comes in, it's already in a profile for them. So just really easy to, like, manage."

So our fees are for in person transactions are 2.45% plus 15¢. But, yeah, I know Square is I do hear a lot of good things about Square. One thing I hear from people, from Square, it's you know, it's it wasn't built for spas whereas as mangomint was. So I'd say we're an online booking software. We're really a one stop shop. So we obviously handle the booking and scheduling, POS. We can handle payroll. We've got a really a lot of really cool marketing features. I'd love to maybe sit down for, like, twenty to thirty minutes, kinda show you how we we stack up against Square, keep it really high level, answer whatever questions you might have for us. I actually have a little bit of time tomorrow if there's some time that might work for you."

But when they have to, like, create a login or a password or anything like that, it just becomes an issue, then they'll forget their password. And then it takes a moment for them to book, so then they'll call you to book it, and you're like, well, okay. Guess I'll book you over the phone. Yeah. We just try to make it, like, as easy and smooth as possible, but also still up storing all the information, of course, which is really nice.

You wanna focus on them. It'll trigger for their that account, but what it's gonna do is it's also targeted. So it's gonna trigger for the exact service that they have come in for. So they'll get and you don't have to put that part. If you just put their name to be triggered for, like, we haven't seen you in thirty days, they'll get the email saying, like, hey.

The only time I have heard that is when the, like, AWS went down, and then it was, like, out of our hands, unfortunately, or else our system in general. Like, we don't have any glitching or downtime. And then we have customer support that if you reach out to chat, you have seven days a week. Not twenty four hours a day, but I think it's literally twenty hours a day, and it's a live person in The United States that answers you. They can text you, call you, or chat with you. You have, like, my phone number, an account manager phone number, an onboarding, phone number, like, contact information that you can always reach out to us too if you need anything in general. Yeah. But I wanted to ask you, I know that you did your own research and all of that, but I would like to learn more so about the Getaway Spa and, like, how you guys are utilizing Vagaro to see, like and be able to show you, like, a more tailored demo and, like, maybe, like, some some businesses in your area that are using us as well.

I think the the main thing is that it's not purpose built for salons and spas, whereas we are. So we're not only we we not only handle the online booking, but we do the the POS, the marketing. We can handle your payroll if you ever decide to bring on more people. Yeah. And curious, are you doing any any marketing through Wix right now, or do you do that separately?"

We're an all in one platform, and we're really focused on client experience as well as for, like, our customers and your customers. So, like, our online booking, it's actually branded to you, and it's very clean. It's very easy for clients to book appointments, and we don't have logins. It still gets, like, their credit card, have them accept to cancellation. But we're really focused on being as easy as possible to use, but still driving more revenue into your business. So getting people to rebook their appointments, getting people to purchase packages and memberships to come back in, that kind of a thing. And we do like a little bit of everything.

One of the reasons why is Square wasn't originally built for spas and salons. They've kind of just developed it over time, so it doesn't quite have everything that you need. And so it it it checks all the boxes. Like, it is a pretty good platform. I'm not gonna lie. But ours is just kind of, like, the next step. Everything's a lot more automated, streamlined, more on the the business side, like I was saying earlier, to get people to come back in and to spend money, like, reward programs with, like it's their tenth time coming in. You can give them a, you know, $20 client balance to their account that they can spend on their next appointment, like, that kind of a thing."

It's included in your subscription. And then you can say, hey. I have ideas to build this this type of, promotion that you know, and they build it out for you. So you just meet with them and do it. And then you don't have to, like, add buttons to your website or anything like that. It's just a lot simpler to use, and it just sends, like, targeted text messages to your clients based on you can, like, filter them saying, like, people that have been in for the last six months that got a massage or, you know, came in for a scalp treatment or you know, and then just send messages to them.

I do hear good things about Square. The only the only problem with Square is that it's not designed for spas specifically. We're designed with spas in mind. So we have a lot of, you know, automations to help you increase revenue and, you know, designed to help you, a spa owner. One thing in particular we have is something we call Flows. It's an automated marketing tool. So you mentioned, like, you know, you have a lot of you have a dedicated clientele. You you get, you know, referrals through word-of-mouth. We have, tools to automate messages to those to your existing clientele. So let's just say I was I was a client of yours, but I haven't been in in two months. Right? You can automate text messages to me, little little nudges to me to get me back in the door. Also, things like curious. Do you sell any packages or memberships or anything like that, or is it just single sessions?"

Notice that you've been enjoying this service. We sell we sell packages. So smart ways to, you know, automate that marketing, offload that off your plate, and get those those customers coming back in the door more often. I'd I'd love to set aside some time and and give you a tour of the platform, kinda show you how we handle things differently than Square.

And then, you know, maybe things start to pick up next year and it's something worth visit revisiting. While it is more expensive, we can offer you a lot more. We have a lot of tools designed to to boost that revenue for you and get more people coming in the door. So I'd love to still show you even if now is not the right time to to sign on with us, at least you know what else is out there. And if in a few months, it makes sense, you know, we can pick up the conversation then. But, yeah, I have my calendar open for maybe, like, a twenty minute conversation next week.

But with mangomint, ours is 2.45% plus 15¢ for card present, and then card not present is, 2.9% plus 20¢. So just a little more. And then we, of course, have, like, the memberships. We have packages, and we have, our own, like, payroll team if that's something you're interested in. We offer marketing, really everything under the sun, that could be a little similar to, like, Vagaro. But I was just curious, would you be open to setting a day and time where you have, like, twenty minutes to see a free demo of what Mangomint offers and how it looks compared to Vagaro so we can learn more so about your spa as well and see if we might be a good fit for you, whether for now or the future?"

But what happens is it puts you in a marketplace with every other one of your competitors. So while someone may be drawn to see, oh, hey. I can see them right here because it's easy for me to search them in Vagaro, there is still, like, a plethora of other people. So with us, we keep our market our marketing a little bit more simplified. It's actually a lot more automated. It's a set it and forget it type marketing, and there is no marketplace involved.

So you wanna send them something to be like, hey. Come back. Make your next appointment. Right? That's the most common example I can think of. But you would just put in the software when you first, like, log in and and are setting everything up. Hey. If a client hasn't made their next appointment and it's been four to six weeks, send them an email with an offer code saying, hey. Use this offer code to get a certain amount off or use this coupon or whatever, at online booking and then come back in. So then after you say that's what I wanna do, mangomint actually recognizes that, and you don't have to go in and recognize when people haven't been in. Meevo:Meet does it for you.

I, of course, did see you guys were using Meevo for, like, your online booking. I was just curious if you guys were open and interested in hearing a little bit about mangomint and what our modern booking system kind of entails.

It gets their credit card, has them accept the cancellation policy or any other spa policies that you have right then and there. But on the back end of mangomint, what really makes us different is I mean, there's so many different features that we have that I can mention, but we're really focused on getting clients to come back in, getting them to purchase packages, sign up for memberships, just getting clients that are already coming in to be, like, loyal clients, kinda take that next step, help with, bringing more revenue in month to month.

We're the best out there as far as, like, cut or client experience goes. So when people book appointments, they can purchase packages online, sign up for memberships. It's very clean. It's very it's just so easy to book, but it's beautiful. And we don't have logins. So it still gets their credit card on file, has them accept the cancellation policy. You can have them fill out a form right then and there, and it connects to their profile. And then based off of the form as well, you can mark it directly to that person if they answer in a certain way to get them to come back in, that kind of a thing. And I did see that you were using Wix as your online booking, and I was curious to know I know that in the last, like, six months, they've gotten better. Like, they've added a couple of new things.

It's just nice because you can play around with it, see what the result process looks like. It has pretend staff members. You can add your own staff members. And so you can just kind of play around with it, see what, you know, permissions you can give staff, what customizations you can do. One thing that the reason why I like to bring my coworker into it is we've had people get so creative with using us that they show you, like, extra cool ways of, like, setting up the online booking to, like, ask questions and that kind of thing. So having it more unique because even some some places, they offer, like, a drink when you walk in, and so you can have the quest yes. And so you already know what the client wants before they walk in. And so you can. Yeah. And it's it's such an amazing software. My favorite part about it, honestly, is even though we're not, like, a budget software, the software gets so many more bookings and gets so many more people coming back in, purchasing packages, you know, getting people to sign up for memberships. It pays for itself over and over again. So and it's just such a good it's such a good software. It's amazing. I've loved using it for my salon. So I will send over that trial account. And do you have a a cell phone number that I can text you at? That way you have my my cell phone number."

And then so it wouldn't be, like, until April, May that you would have to pay for the subscription. And then we're also throwing in, like, all of the hardware, including an iPad.

I guess the the main differentiator we actually bring over the most people from Vagaro of any other software is people don't love the the booking process. So, like, I come to your branded website. I go to book now, I end up getting redirected to a different page, and then it makes me put in a username and login in order to book. How we handle that is we we just we create an overlay on your site. So if you go to book now, we just pop up on the left hand side, and we just ask for first and last name and a phone number in order to book. And we do that because it's one, it's it's just a lot easier for people. They don't have to remember username and password to log in. And then also easier on your end because it it eliminates the possibility of, like, creating duplicates in your system."

But, yeah, we actually I do hear a lot of good things about Vagaro, but it is the number one software that we switch people over from. So, I guess, probably the biggest reason is people don't love the online booking process. So, like, I come to your nicely branded website. I click book online. It redirects me to Vagaro, which is a marketplace, and then requires a username and and password for login. So not sure if that's something you've you've heard from your clients at all, but we how we'd handle that is we would create an overlay on your website. So if you click book now, never takes you off the site, just pops up on the left side of the page. And we don't require username or login for a couple reasons. One, it just makes it easier. People don't have to remember their username and password. So, yeah, ease of use for the clients. But for you as well, it eliminates the possibility of, like, duplicates in your system.

I'd love to set up some time maybe next week to give you a tour of the platform, show you how we stack up against Vagaro, then answer whatever questions you have for me. Curious.

So when they call, it pops up their profile, and you can just book an appointment really quickly, as well as, like, two way texting and web chat. It's all included. So that has been released since the last time I talked with you. And it's the same price as our two way texting was before, but now you get phones and the web chat for all the same price. So that's, like, freaking awesome. So we'll show you a little bit of that as well and then just dive into, like, what people use most, what things that you're looking for, that kind of a thing. I'm gonna send over a text message. I am gonna loop in Caroline. She has been with the company for, like, four years, and she's managed salons and spas. And so she's just, like, absolutely phenomenal with, like, actually showing the product really well for, like, your needs. So I'm gonna send a text a group text just with the three of us.

So kind of in the in the main difference from us and Vagaro is, like, I so I come to your website. I click book appointment. It redirects me to Vagaro. So sometimes people don't people don't know what site they're at. Sometimes maybe they might think of they this took me to a different spa or salon. So what we do is we create an overlay on your website. So if I came to book now with mangomint, we just overlay on the left side of your page, never take anyone away from the page, completely branded to your site. We also never require a username or login like Vagaro does. So we do that for a couple reasons. One, just ease of use. Like, I think anyone could could figure out how to do that. It just prompts you to enter enter your name, phone number, and then shows you available dates and times. With Vagaro, you have to enter the username or login. I I think about myself and, like, I would I'm terrible at remembering passwords and stuff. So, yeah, so people end up creating, you know, new accounts when they can't remember, and then you've got multiples. Yeah. So you've got multiples in your system. So that's one thing. Yeah. And then we've got some really cool advanced marketing tools. Curious. Do you do any marketing through Vagaro?"

We also have what we call flows. It's automated marketing tools. So let's just say, for example, you know, I'm a customer. I've been in for you know, I've been in 10 times. You could send me on my tenth visit a little. Hey. Thanks so much for being a valued customer. Here's 20% off. So we can automate things like that. Also, say, I'm a customer, but I haven't been in in three months. Just giving them gentle nudges without any work on your side to get them to rebook. We can also handle, like, the the POS. We do payroll, obviously, the marketing. And but understand I threw a lot of info at you. I'd love to maybe jump on, like, a thirty minute screen share. What we could do is, like, I could walk you through the platform, kinda show you how we stack up against Vagaro, and then, you know, answer whatever questions you might have. Is there a day or time this week that might work best for you?"

        "text": "Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm, like, in comparison between, like, mangomint and Vagaro and even, like, Meevo. So me mangomint, we're the next step from platforms like Square and Vagaro. We're really focused on customer experience. So when clients check out, it's absolutely seamless and just flawless and really, really easy to book, and also prompting clients to add any additional, like, service customization. So, you know, like, an extra ten minutes added to their massage or a facial or, you know, like, a hand treatment, something like that to get them spending more within that one service. But the coolest thing about us is that we don't have logins. So it still creates a file, gets their credit card, has them accept the cancellation, and it creates, you know, all of the stuff inside of the software for them. They just don't have to remember a password or reset it. And then, like, compared to Meevo, I've actually worked with a lot of people that use Meevo, have kind of wanted to transition away from them. Meevo is a very robust platform, so you're paying a lot of money for a lot of things that you're not using, and it's really hard to learn. That's, like, the number one thing that I hear from people is that it's just a difficult software to to navigate through. And so we we kinda provide all of the things that you really need, but making it as easy as possible, pretty much. And then, like, we're all about, like, saving time and helping just increase revenue month over month, you know, getting more people to purchase packages, sign up for memberships with our targeted client marketing, which is, like, absolutely phenomenal. And what I do is I do, like, a twenty minute screen share. It's kind of like a demo, but it's more so just to show you, like, current customers of ours, what their online booking looks like, and then kinda just dive into, like, your story and your needs, and then show you how mangomint can can work with that, see if it makes sense. It's just educational. Is that something that you'd be open to doing?"

And so people are like, I just don't have I don't have time for that. I don't have time. I want as many bookings as possible, and I don't want there to be any difficulty for my clients. And so I totally get that. So as far as, like, moving over, it can be done so quickly, and just very, seamless. We have an onboarding team that handles the migration for you. And so it's very, very seamless, very quick, easy. So you can kinda decide your timeline, and then launch it whenever. What is a good email that I can grab from you?"

It's completely free, and it's in demo mode so you can play around with it. We like to give it to you as kind of like a tool so you can actually see the software and use it. Yeah. And so, like, that's why I just like to send it over. It in the email, you just have to click, like, activate, and then you just create a password, and then you can log in whenever. The trial is about, like, twenty something days. So it also gives you a little extra time if you wanna play around or not. But other than that, I'll send over a text message.

And if you did want it to look, I know we have, like, some promos that'll be running towards the end of the year that could make sense to to get you rolling. One of the one of the big things that we just launched last month, actually, it's called Connect. So if you were talking to I I think it was Jenna back when. She probably told you about two way texting. Within that that functionality now, we have a tool that's called Connect. So it's kind of our marketing buzzword thing. But it includes website chat and phone systems now. So you could actually put website chat along with the online booking directly on your website. It looks like it's coming soon. And then all of your client communications will live in one place. So this is really great. It's something definitely none of our competitors have. So we're we're excited about it. One of the reasons I wanted to call because I it hopefully can save you a little bit of additional steps if you wanted to do website chat. Usually, you have to do it with someone else.

But for the most part, we build everything internally, and that allows us to support everything. And so our support team is amazing. If if you look this up online, you'll see we're we're usually rated at or near number one in support across the board.

And I actually am not here to say anything bad about Vagaro. I like Vagaro. I think it's a fantastic software to start out. Mango kinda here to, like, take you guys to the next step as you start growing, to take the training wheels off a little bit as far as software goes. So we have some really cool features, especially with room booking, marketing as well. One thing I will that people recently who use Vagaro, have been coming over to us have been saying, and I'm curious for your feedback on this as well, is the you have to create a profile to log in to book an appointment. And a lot of clients don't like that because they can barely remember that they had the appointment in the first place, let alone a password. So with mangomint, we actually got rid of that feature completely. So when you hit the book now button, it takes you to an overlay on your website. So it keeps you on, like, your beautiful first screen that you have with, like, your felt glow, and then I'm assuming you and your business partner. That's you too in the picture."

So I didn't know if, like, that was a sticky point that you've heard from people before. It was just some feedback we got, we so made sure to get rid of that on our end."

        "text": "Yeah. Yeah. So the problem with Vagaro is when it takes you on to, like when you're doing marketing and stuff, it takes you on to, like, their marketplace. Right? So it gets confusing. And there's not a lot like, it's a little bit clunky and almost I heard it's, like, mosaic, which is, like, a really fancy word for saying it looks a little bit old and boxed, be able to kind of, like, figure things out. So we did simplify our mark bit and streamline it. The thing we don't like is when we are all people of this industry, like, whole team is, not just me. So we don't like things aren't visually good to look at because it makes it a lot harder. So with our marketing, everything you can custom and brand specifically to you to make it look like you, not you trying to use us to make it look like you, if that makes sense. Like, it's very new coded. It looks like it came from you. It doesn't look like it came from mangomint done by you."

        "text": "Yeah. My favorite thing is, like, forget it type feature because you're still behind the chair, or table. And your partner is getting back behind the chair. Everybody you have is getting back behind the chair, so no one really has time to sit and, like, finesse and finagle. So we have something for marketing that's called flows. That work means nothing to you right now, but it's essentially just trigger marketing. So you set it up once. We actually have a team dedicated to help you setting it up, and it could be used for anything. It could be used for rebooking where you tell Manglement, like, okay. Any client that has not been back in four weeks, I wanna send them an offer code that they can apply an online booking to entice them to come back in. That's all you put in Manglement. Manglement does the rest. So then from that point on, any client that hasn't been in at that four week mark or whatever you set it to automatically gets sent a campaign, basically saying, here we haven't seen you in a while. Here's an offer code. Come back in and book the appointment. You can do it for retail. You can do it for birthdays. You can pretty much finesse it to do it for whatever you want, which is like, if someone hasn't bought you said you wanna get people into products more. If a customer hasn't bought, like, bought a product in six weeks, flows can recognize that based off of their history, and then that will automatically, once you set the parameters, send them, text and emails basically saying like, hey. It's time for you to re up. Come on in, make your appointment, and let's get you some more products. Just to kinda help that ex yeah. But you don't have to constantly remember it. Like I said, it's set up once. We have a team to help you set it up so you're not on your own. And then it just kinda, like, goes into the wild on your own while you're back there making everyone else feel nice and relaxed. You're not relaxed, but everyone else around you feels your whole back."

If you have some time right now or if there's, like, a better time I could reach you next week just to chat for a little bit."

So our price point is a little higher than others, but we are, like, a one stop and everything communicates really well together. And we want to make everything as easy and smooth as possible for you and your clients' booking and, like, your staff as well. So would love to still at least, you know, maybe show you, like, show you, like, a brief demo on on what we do in comparison to Acuity so you can see the benefit of it and see if it would be something suitable for you for now or the future. I did see you have, like, classes and, like, saunas and stuff as well. So we have a lot of really, really great, like, tools to help book all of those that that are not, like, workarounds. So it's just, like, really smooth and easy. So we'd love to show you, like, what that looks like and some, like, salons and spas in your area that use mangomint as well. Yeah. Cool. That, I was gonna ask you. That usually takes, like, twenty, twenty five minutes if you're open to scheduling that. If you're looking at your calendar, we can get that scheduled. And then whatever day works for you next week, I can reach out in the morning and just confirm that that time still works. Then if you need to move it, we can move it."

What will happen is, let's say, for that staff member, we're gonna put instead of a name, we're gonna put yoga. And under that yoga, on the back end, we'll help you customize this, by the way. You can put a capacity. So you can put up to 10 like, individuals can sign up for this class. They just literally sign up that they wanna do a yoga, and it will go input in your system that they're signing up for yoga at whatever time the class is. And if it hits that 10% capacity, it will not allow another person to add. They can join the wait list if they want to."

So we are a spa booking software, and we honestly just wanted to show our love and support because we came across your website, and did see that you guys currently do have a software that you guys are using. But wanted to just see, like, how Meevo's been for you guys and if you've ever heard of mangomint, and if you'd be here open to hearing a little bit about how we differ from Meevo and would love to learn more about your guys' thoughts."

I would I know you're super happy with Meevo, but I would love to send over, I think I did actually send over a brief, insight on, like, what mangomint offers and how we are different from Meevo. So I can send over, like, another email just to make sure that you guys got that email and some info on us. I'll make sure to send over the gift for you guys as well because, you know, we just wanted to show our love and support. So if you guys didn't get it, we would love to send another for you. But I did wanna tell you, something really cool with mangomint is we're, like, a really modern, easy to use software. And right now, when I'm on your website and I click book now, it actually takes me away from your site and your brand and takes me to Meevo's external page. And Vagaro does the same thing where it takes you to an external page where you actually need to log in with a password and, like, your username in order to book an appointment. With Manglement, we want booking to be as easy as possible for your client. So when a client clicks book now like I'm doing right now, an overlay would open directly on your website. It will never redirect them to mangomint site, so they can actually book on your website. This will allow more bookings on your website and get your SEO count up as well, which is really great. And because we don't have a login or a password, it allows for a lot of rebookings and a lot of new clients to book because they don't have to log in in order to see, like, a service provider or the service then to book an appointment and, like, have to, you know, create the password or whatnot. So that is something that I know we do very differently than Meevo. Do your clients ever mention that to you guys that they're having issues, like, logging in or whatnot?"

And then we have so we have payroll. We have inventory, we have processing. I think our processing rates are also lower than Booker's as well. And then yeah. And then we're month to month, no contracts. And we also have, like, a mangomint connect, which is, like, phones, two way texting, and web chat, but it's all in one place inside the app, and it connects it to their profile.

Like, what I do is, like, a twenty minute, thirty minute screen share, kind of like a demo just to show you, like, current customers of ours, see if potentially we would be a good fit. We work very, very well for spas, like resource booking, packages, memberships, you know, targeted client marketing.

But I'm so glad that you got it. We just wanted to, you know, show our love and support and hopefully put a smile on your face. But I did see, of course, you were using on your website, Daysmart. I kind of just wanted to see how long you've been using them for, and how they've been for you, and if you were open to, like, hearing a little bit about mangomint by any chance, if you had some time right now, or if there's, like, a better time that I could reach you."

That was, like, a lot of work that I put into that. Yeah. And so, I mean, as far as mangomint goes, we're kind of, like, the next step from Vagaro. We have a smarter system. We're really built for client experience. So making sure when they're booking an appointment, it's absolutely phenomenal. It's really easy to do, but it's also, like, branded to you. And then also having, like, the customizations for, hey. Like, do you wanna add a, you know, a a paraffin wax dip on your hands? Do you wanna do a deep condition on your hair? It's like getting people to spend more money, and upsell themselves before they even walk in so it books out, like, the proper amount of time and everything."

And it's like looking to pamper yourself, add these on. Or you know? And then they have another question of, are you dealing with dry skin? Or some even just ask questions and have their clients select them so then they know more about their hair or their skin before they come in. And then we also have fully integrated forms. I know Vagaro has forms, but ours are fully integrated. You can also add tags to them. So when somebody fills something out and then you're running, like, a marketing campaign, then you can select for that specific thing and then send, like, a a text message saying, hey. Like, here's we're having a deal for this. We know that you like this service or you deal with dry skin or whatever it is. And so, yeah, I mean, I would love to show you it's just educational to show you, like, those customers of ours that I was talking about. And then just, like, show you how we're different, how we have more automations, how, like, better working our system is, kinda show you that client experience. Is that something that you'd be open to? It's about, like, twenty, thirty minutes. I bring in a coworker. Once again, there's no hard sell. It's just to show you how we're different, how we help salons kind of see if we would potentially be a good fit."

        "text": "So ours, we only have three add ons, and then we have three tiers. So we don't have any contracts. It's month to month. And then it kinda just depends on there's two different things that I like to say. One being how many service providers you have that have calendars, not including admin, or front desk or anything like that, just the calendars held. So that kind of basis, like, puts you kind of in a tier. And then the second thing would be is if you're looking for some of our more advanced features, like our mid and high tier, our, like, our virtual waiting room. So when a client gets there ten minutes before their appointment, a text message is sent to them, and they check-in and it alerts the service provider saying, hey. Your client is here. Make your way to the front. Or then they can text them back and say, hey. I'm just barely cleaning up. I need about five minutes. Just take a seat. I'll be there soon. Or, like, our express booking, which is, like, booking over the phone. It's similar to, like, our online booking. It just you just need their name and their phone number, and it sends them a text message, but it gets them to accept the cancellation policy and any other policies you have. So liability wise, it makes sure that every single client that comes in is is accepting that. So, you know, kinda protects your bottom line and then gets their credit card, without taking it over the phone. So that's always a bonus. Mhmm."

        "text": "So all you do is so you just get there so say that I'm calling in, hey. I would like to get this facial. You just take my name, my phone number, put the facial in there, and it sends me a text message. It holds the spot on the calendar. You can select how much time they have. It kind of varies. I see customers do, like, a full twenty four hours. I see some customers do thirty minutes. And then all your front desk says, okay. I sent over a text message to your phone. Confirm that within the next thirty minutes, and then it will, like, confirm your appointment for you. Or it just it just saves time. So, like, really, it's like it takes, you know, fifteen seconds to send the text message, and then the phone call is done. And then if they wanna answer any questions, obviously, they can do that. But it just saves time, but then also helps get their credit card, have them accept that cancellation. So it's like a very unique feature that mangomint has. And then we also have connect, which Vagaro doesn't have anything quite like it. I know that they have their two way texting, but our connect is web chat, text messages, and phones all within our main Go Mint app, and it connects the client's profile. So when somebody calls in, you can create a you select and create an appointment for them. If they're a returning customer, you can track all of their communications. If they've gone on the website, if they've texted or called, you can see if they've left voice mails. And so it just kinda helps you stay on top of, like, how often you've talked to them, you know, what their past conversations have looked like, if they've had any concerns. So it just helps you be more connected because multiple people can, you know, talk to different clients. And so it just helps just maintain that, you know, that customer experience making it feel more personal. So yeah. And, I mean, I just do that that twenty minute screen share. Do you have time today or possibly Monday?"

Just helps create a kind of a frictionless booking process. But, yeah, I'd love to set up some time to show you how we stack up.

I know that salons and spas and all businesses are managed and run completely different. So, my my job is to call and get an understanding and see if we can find a good day and time to maybe schedule a demo to hop on and and learn more about you guys that way and share more about mangomint. So I'm so happy that I did catch you today. I appreciate your time. I did wanna tell you with our POS rates for the credit card processing, you guys do have a very high high credit card processing. So we may be able to give you, like, some custom ratings, but my account executive would have to run that by for you. But just so you're aware, as of right now, our standard for our POS credit card rates, if a card is present within the salon and spa, it is 2.45% plus 15¢. And if a card is not present and we're virtually charging your clients, then the percentage fee is 2.9% plus 20¢. Do you know what your current rates are? And are you using Vagaro or somebody else for your POS currently?"

The thousand dollars, like, you just said the example, and then $9.85 would come to you. That doesn't seem like any sort of a percentage, so it kinda seems a little strange. But I would love to.

I I'm I'm opening this is my second practice, but I closed my first one because I moved to a a city two hours south of where I was. And so, essentially, I'm opening and starting from scratch, and I've kinda reformatted things. So everything that kind of applied there, I'm really taking it in a in a different direction now. So I've added an aesthetics arm, but the aesthetics arm that I've added is not like the typical med spa. I really want it to be, like, regenerative, integrative, naturopathic with the machines and the modalities, the packages, the membership.

Where it's, like, reach like, our software reaches out to people that have, like for instance, it's our flow feature. So it's targeted client marketing through text messages and emails. So, basically, you can come with any idea. Keep that in mind. Any idea you have, like, you pretty much can build it out. So say that somebody has come in for two facials. Once the that that condition has been met, it triggers a text message to be sent to them saying, hey. We think that you'd be a perfect fit for this package. So it sells them on the packages automatically, so it's something that you don't have to handle. We're, like, a huge like, we're huge about, like, increasing revenue, helping make companies more successful, but also saving them time kind of a thing. You can have it be like, it's their tenth visit, and you send them a $20 service credit to their accounts that they can use on their next appointment. It can be, you know, happy birthday or there's so many different text messages that you can do, but also you can create your own. So that's, like, my most favorite thing that we have. As far as, like, couple booking, room assignments, all of that, we handle that very seamlessly. So if somebody books online, it's for couples massage, they can fill out their information. We don't have login. So they still get their credit card or a deposit, have them accept the cancellation policy. It just makes it easier for them to book. And then it will book the appointment, for the the different service providers with with the resource included. So, resource can be anywhere from a room to a massage table to a machine, hot stones, towels even. I've seen people use them for,"

And then you can group together appointments during checkout, or you can just, you know, say that one person is paying for themselves where the rest one person is paying. You can check them out in that way, and then it pays out the correct amount for each of the service providers and what they, like, made for that. It gives them, like, proper reporting to pay them."

We have a feature called connect, and it's phones, web chat, and two way texting all in one place. It connects to client's profile. So when they call in, like, it pops up and you can book an appointment through their profile. So, like, that's also really cool, but we do inventory, reporting, marketing. But, like, our main focus, honestly, is customer experience. We want our customers to have the best experience, and we want their customers to have the best experience. So making sure that it's it's very clean, very easy to book, making sure that, you know, it's just, like, top notch service provided, saving time, you know, helping to get more people to come back and purchase more services, purchase packages, memberships, that kind of a thing. There's so much into our software. We're kind of like the next step from Acuity. So more more, you know, automation, easier to use. Acuity is actually a really good, site, but I know that they have, like, a couple of things that, like, it's not as robust. But I was curious. I did see that you were using Acuity, and just to see, you know, what your experience has been like. Are there things that you have, like, absolutely loved about their booking, things that you wish were a little bit better?"

So it's like hiring a an extra employee where, like, we have so many automations. It's so seamless that actually saves you a lot of time. So as far as that goes, a lot of people see it as, like, an investment in an extra employee that they're not paying, like, a full, you know, $6,700 for a month. And then we're also really built for growing, you know, increasing revenue, getting customers when they book to add services on to that additional, or additionally add add ons to a service. So it raises their, like, ticket prices and getting them to be more consistent with coming in, you know, getting them to sign up for memberships, that kind of a thing. And so we are more about, like, the the saving time, but also, like, the revenue side. We can make you more money, get more people to come back in. So it is an investment, but it's not, like, an insane price. It's not $5,600. Some some companies are, so granted, but we're we're you'd probably be at our lowest tier, and that's up to 10 service providers. And then you and it's $1.65 a month. And then we don't do contracts. It's month to month. But then we also offer, like, free trials and and that kind of a thing so you could test it out. I would love to just show you a little bit more of, like, what our capabilities are even down to, like, the simplest of things that other softwares haven't thought through, but show you, like, current customers of ours, what their online booking looks like, how they use us, and just kinda dive into, like, your needs and show you how we can help with that. Is that something that you'd be open to doing? It's just like a twenty minute screen share with me and my coworker."

It still gets their credit card, has them accept the cancellation policy. But then we also do, like, like, point of sale. We do payroll, inventory, marketing. We do a little bit of everything, even, like, communication. So we have, like, our two way texting, phones, and web chat all in one place. But it's, like, connected to the client's profile, that kind of a thing. I just wanted to kind of follow-up, see where you were at, and possibly see if there was a time next week that we can meet for, like, twenty minutes just to show it to you, like, current customers, that kind of a thing."

How many do you currently have?"

The second tier is up to 20, and that's two forty five. And then it also includes the difference between the two, would be it includes, like, our express booking, our virtual waiting room, and then also memberships. So the essentials plan still includes, like, packages. It just doesn't have those three. And then more calendars are available."

I get a text message, like, ten minutes before my appointment just saying, hey. When you arrive, check-in. So I check-in, and then it alerts the service provider that their client is there. So it kinda helps with, like, front desk, make sure that they're taken care of. If somebody you know, if their front desk is is busy, you know, doing inventory or restocking or, you know, the back and forth that they kinda do. So that's the virtual waiting room. The express booking is where somebody calls in and you just need their, like, first name and phone number. And you actually can just text them a link, and they fill out their info except that cancellation policy or any other policies you have. So, like, liability, every client of yours is approving that, and then also getting your credit card. So security wise, it's a lot more secure than taking it over the phone. And it's"

But, like, say that you did want, like, a full prepayment, then, you can just set it to, like, a 100% deposit, and then they can pay up front for it.

So say that, like, on their Instagram, they have their booking link in their bio. And then when clients are on their page and wanna book with them, it just goes straight to them.

We believe that it's your data and you have the right to everything. So if you ever did leave mangomint and you get everything, we don't make it difficult to have access to that and to transfer everything.

So if they have certain machines, if you have certain rooms that people use, like, I've worked with one person, and she has a similar setup where it's all contractors, but she actually has a head spa in one of rooms, and so she gives access to the other booth renters. So but you don't want it to get double booked, and it's hard to look at other people's schedules, that kind of a thing. So if somebody goes online to book it, it books out the room and it books out the service provider. So you can also kind of configure it. In that way, if you have specific things that you want to offer and I think that she charged, like, 20 or 30% of what the service cost was. That's what the, oh my gosh. What is it called? The the actual service provider, the contractor paid her to use that room. Or, you know, like, other pay extra rent or, like, whatever you want or if it's 50% of the service or so, like, at least they have access to it. But, also, it kinda goes down to, like, are they using their own products? Are you supplying the product? You know? So it kinda is, like, up to you.

There's one in particular that I wanna show you. But and then we kinda dive into the software, just, like, basics of how to use it. And then I can also send over a trial account, as well. It's just free. It's just, like, in demo mode, so fake clients and stuff that you can kinda play around with it. And then I bring in a coworker of mine, and they're the ones that kind of, like, walk you through it. They're, like, more in-depth product specialists. I am a product specialist, but, like, those are very, like, unique niche things that they typically deal with. And so they can give you an exact answer if that is something we can or can't do."

They can understand you. And it's typically anywhere from it being pretty instant because they are human beings. There is a minute or two delay just because they're, you know, messaging as many people as they can, but, up to, like, five minutes. So or you can pull a call.

So if you do have a question, you can just type a keyword in the search bar, and it will pull up all the articles, all the videos. But as far as, like, moving over goes, we actually have an onboarding team. So kind of the process of that is you'd meet with them, figure out kind of what your timeline is. I typically say a week to move everything over, make sure that everything is set up in the way that you want. You can have it move quicker than that. I've seen people do it within twenty four hours. So it's it's really up to you. And then you get a specific onboarding manager, assigned to you, and they really help take that over. They talk to you about, like, okay, how are you wanting things to be set up, and then they'll show you how to do that, if not just set it up for you. And so and and we don't charge onboarding fees, transfer fees, none of that. It's completely complimentary. You're just paying for the subscription, and that's it. We also have a customer profit team as well, which is completely free to reach out to them, meet with them at any point. You can meet with them once a month. You can meet with them quarterly, however often you want, and they can actually help set up flows, which our flows are targeted client marketing. So if you're wanting to look for, clients that have been in for this service three times and offer a package, offer a membership, get them to come back in, It's their birthday, client loyalty programs. There's so much. You just come with your ideas, and they can build it out for you. But, also, you can use flows for, like, automation, so to automate tasks, that kind of a thing. So once a certain condition has been hit from that client, it automatically takes care of it for you kind of a thing. And and that's completely free as far as that team goes. And so yeah. And we can kinda dive into just, like, the basics so you can see it so it makes more sense. It or sound more complicated. But, like, when you actually see it, you're like, oh, okay. No. That makes sense. So let me grab your email, and then I can send over we can find a time, and I can send over the link for the screen share. What is the best email?"

You can cancel it. And then also, they get a text message, and it's up to you once again if you want to enable this to have them confirm their appointment. And so it it's all done through those text messages. They just don't have logins. And so, like, also, when people book appointments, if they're using the same browser, like, I go to two different places that use Mingo Mint, and regardless, it auto populates my info because I've used that, you know, browser because I use Google Chrome on my iPhone because I'm a freak, but it just, like, auto populates it.

We can generate that specific code for those clients and put it in their profile so that we know that those clients will receive that. But when they book, they won't necessarily see on their end that they're booking, like, something cheaper. You know what I mean? But once they're in, they will get the discount. Yeah.

        "speaker": "Sanaz Jahanmir",
        "timestamp": "00:04:45",
        "text": "Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. It's really like, I call businesses all day, so I know that all, like, spas and businesses are managed and run totally different. So it is important for me to understand, you know, how you guys are utilizing them and what's important to you. So with that said, I did wanna share that with mangomint, we have, we're an all in one solution. So we wanna help you make, easing excuse me, make booking as easy as possible for your clients and make your day to day to day and your staff's day to day as smooth as possible as well. So whether it's, like, spa packages, couple of massages, all of that, we are able to do all of that for you. And a good thing is that we are able to actually set deposit, for specific services. So the way that you mentioned certain services might be a little more expensive or, a higher price point or, longer services and you wanna make sure you have that deposit, it is crucial to, you know, make sure that you are taking care of yourself and your staff. So we make sure that we're able to do that for you. So we are able to do that for you. We do have full customization as well for you and your staff according to, like, time intervals, pricing, description, all of that can be totally separate and customizable for each of you, which is really nice. Something that is different between mangomint and Vagaro is, right now, when I'm on your website and I click book online, I'm actually redirected to Vagaro's external page where clients need to log in in order to book an appointment. With mangomint, we wanna focus on you and your brand. So what we would do is we would add an overlay directly to your website. So when I click book online, the overlay would pop up directly on your site, never redirects us, and clients do not need to put in a password or a login in order to book their appointment. They can go ahead and put in their name, phone number, and email, and all information will be populated, because we are cloud based, which is really nice. Something else that's really great too is we have our own payroll, our own POS system as well. We have our own marketing team. We can help you build out different, like, campaigns if that's something that you're interested in. And, yeah, just a lot of great communication tools if you are looking for, like, two way texting with your clients and a phone number to make phone calls with your clients within the app, we are able to provide that for you as an add on just to make communication a lot smoother and easier. We just launched web chat as well so we can add that widget to your website as well if that is something that you are looking for to be able to communicate with your clients that way. So just a lot of great tools that are, again, easy to use and wanna help you and your staff just have, like, a smooth day to day. I wanted to see, Cory, if you had any time this week or, like, early next week where we can set for twenty, twenty five minutes to hop on a quick demo screen share to actually be able to show you what our system looks like in comparison to Vagaro so you can visually see what I kinda just talked about."

So there may be a workaround where we can help you on the event side. Like I said, we do support group bookings. And then we can you wouldn't have to change your website at all. We'd actually integrate with your Wix site. So you could you could utilize this for online booking in those summer months if that makes sense. But I'd love to set up maybe some time for a screen share with one of my product experts, Kyle. That way, we could we could try to figure out maybe a workaround to help you with those those group events and then, you know, see where we can help you in those those heavier summer months. Curious.

So we have a lot of, like, customization, whether it's, like, time intervals or adjusting certain things like that, which is really great for, like, you and your staff. And something that we do differently is right now when I'm on your website and I click book now, it actually takes me away from your brand and website and takes me to Vagaro's external page where clients can book there and have to, like, log in with a password and whatnot. With mangomint, we actually wanna focus on your brand. So we would add an overlay, like a widget to your website. So an overlay would open directly on your site, and clients can book directly on there with no login or password needed. So all their info will get stored in the cloud. This allows for a lot of rebookings and bookings new bookings in general because clients don't have to, like, create a password or remember yet another password, which is really nice.

And you can text me a link over the phone, And me as the new client would receive a link where I can approve, like, your consent form. I can add my credit card information. I can add my name, my email, just accept any consent and my appointment as well. If there's any forms that I need to fill out too, I can fill out any forms that you would want attached to any specific services. That's totally customizable per service as well. So then that form will get attached to that client's profile, and a new profile would will be made once they, like, fill out the information and click the appointment, and it'll get booked for them. So that saves you guys time, but also allows the client to be prepared once they come in so they don't have to, like, fill out any info or anything once they're in the in the actual spa."

And then, like, for the POS, for the point of sale, we do have as well. We also have our own payroll as well, which is really great. We have, like, two way texting ability, phone calls, web chat within your website as well. We have memberships, packages, really easy to use online booking with no login or password needed for your clients. We have digital intake forms, so we are able to collect information from clients, and those forms will actually be attached to client profile, which is really great. You can have consent documentation, build unique offer codes and discount codes. We have ability for, like, SOAP notes as well and, like, before and after photos and all of that too. And and actually, like, a markup screen as well, which is really, really nice, a digital markup. Yeah. I know me, like, saying all these things out loud is, like, not so helpful. So I'm just explaining kind of what we offer, but I would love to show you all that I just mentioned in our demo just so you can visually see what they kind of entail and if they would be suitable for your business.

But the reason I was calling was because my team and I had sent over in the mail a little gift for you guys, and it would have been super random. So in case you were like, where did this come from? The gift actually had an eye sleeping mask in it, some cute little stickers, and, like, gourmet gummy bears. Did you guys ever receive that back in October by any chance?"

And if anything kinda sparks your interest, I would love to set up a time where you have, like, twenty, twenty five minutes to just see, like, a free educational screen share demo where we can just walk you through mangomint, our software, and learn more about your business as well. We really focus here at mangomint on, like, building your brand, and we want booking to be as easy and smooth as possible for your clients. So we would add, like, a BookNow widget to your website, and the widget would open up when a client clicks the BookNow button. It would open up immediately. Clients do not need to have a login or password in order to book appointments, which is really nice. All information gets stored in the cloud. All they would need to do is put in their first name, phone number, and email. And then we have quite a bit of tools to help you as the business owner as well. We have, like, web chat, two way texting for your clients if you are looking for something like that. We have, of course, as well, like, notifications for clients once they book an appointment. Totally customizable, so you can decide how many times you would want clients to receive, like, a notification, whether it's two days before, one day, and day of. And we have a lot of great tools, whether it's if you're offering, like, packages, memberships, anything like that. Our system all works really well together to get any of that sold for you online or in person. And then I was going to ask you, do you guys get phone calls in for bookings, or do they mainly do it online?"

And what that is is more so for clients that are, like, newer or that like to call in. What we are trying to make easier and smoother for you is, let's say, I'm the client. I called you right now, and I want an appointment tomorrow at 2PM. What you can do is go to the calendar, click that 2PM time slot, and then, actually, instead of you booking and getting their information over the phone, you can text them a link, and that link will allow them to approve your consent. So any cancellation, anything like that, if you want them to fill out any forms, you can have that there as well. They can put in their credit card if you are collecting a deposit or want that for any cancellation. And then they can go ahead and, like, approve the appointment, and the appointment will get booked. So that way, you're not having to sit there and spend a few minutes to, like, grab their name and phone number and whatnot. So little things like that that are really cool with our system, to help you with your with your day to day."

I would like, seamless booking, like, buying gift cards would be great. We're getting a brand new website built, so this is kind of, like, the perfect opportunity to look into a new system as well.

But just to highlight that, we actually don't have a login feature for people to, like, create accounts because we've noticed with a lot of people who use softwares that require a login to book appointments, it just gets really messy and sometimes pushes people towards the phone. So when they're online booking, what's gonna happen is you're gonna have this beautiful brand new website that I'm sure you're working very hard on, and we're just gonna overlay for that as a side panel. So you're not being taken off the website at at all. They're staying on what you worked really hard to build, and then we're popping up on the side. From there, they can do packages, memberships, and gift cards really easy, which is the click of the button. And then it's pretty quick and seamless for them to book appointment.

I just took note on everything you just said because it's super helpful for us to get an understanding because every, like, salon and business is, of course, managed differently. So I appreciate you telling me all of that, and I am sorry that your system has been glitchy. That's super frustrating because you just want, you know, going when you're going to work, your system to be working well so that you have a smooth day. And when things are going awry, it just, like, causes problems. So, yeah, I would love to share a little bit about mangomint, and then maybe we can find a time schedule for a demo so you can actually visually see what we offer. But just so you know, with mangomint, so we are like a salon specific software. We do offer a lot of customization and buffer time and time intervals and all of that because we do know that all businesses and individuals are kind of, like, managed and run differently day to day. So you are able to do that fully, all the customization. We do have the commission to your customization for you as well, so we can show you that. We do have text reminders and email reminders for clients. You can set that up unlimited however many days in advance or hours in advance you would like them to receive those notifications. We can set that up for you. We do have ability to sell products, keep up with your inventory as well. So when a product is low, it will alert you that a product is low, which is really awesome. I know you mentioned you guys are using Clover for POS, and the salon schedule is a part of, like, Clover or the sister company as well. Here at mangomint, we actually, are, like, a full business management solution. So we offer everything under the sun. So we have online booking. We have our own POS system, which is really awesome. And our POS rates are 2.45% plus 15¢, which I know are on the lower side for the industry, but we can chat about that with you and get more of an understanding of what yours are. And then I was also going to tell you, we also offer payroll if that is something you're interested in. We cover all, like, ten ninety nine and tax forms and everything for you too, so we can chat about that."

We do actually have the text and email marketing that, we have, like, a really great automated system that we can show you how we can set that up for you where it'll trigger a client to come in. Let's say they haven't been in for a root touch up for, like, six weeks or something, it will automatically alert them to come in for their touch up, which is really great. And then, yeah, we have actually we just launched in October a new add on, and the add on is our new web chat, phone call, and two way texting unlimited with clients. So we would actually provide you with a phone number that would live in your app where you can two way text clients, call clients from that same number, and then clients can actually web chat in, from your website as well if that is something that you guys are interested in."

So whenever you do want to add any of our add ons on, we only have three add ons. Most of our features are included in our price point in general because we know that it'll be beneficial and crucial for your business. But for something like the texting, whenever you guys are wanting, like, a web chat and whatnot, like, a few months or next year, then we can just add that on for you. No problem."

So, we don't have a login or a password for clients to book an appointment. So what we would do is, like, on your website, we can add a book now button, and clients can actually when they click that button, an overlay would open on the site where they can put in their name, phone number, and, email, and their information will be stored in the cloud so they can just go ahead and book an appointment that way, which allows for a lot of rebookings because, you know, they don't have to remember yet another password, which is really cool. And then something else, because I know you said you guys get a lot of phone calls in for appointments, We have this tool called Express Booking, and what it does is let's say, I'm a client. I just called you, and you're super busy, and you just want me to book my appointment as fast as possible. What you would do is over the phone, send me as the client a link. I will open that link, and it will have the day and time that I wanna book the appointment, but it would actually have me as the client fill out the appointment. So I would fill out my information. I would, approve your consent form. I would also add my credit card information if you are collecting, like, a deposit, and then I would secure my appointment that way. So for the people that are calling in, you can actually text them a link to make it easier for you too."

But instead of you sitting there and typing their name and their phone number and all of that, you actually will be, like, Monday at two. You'll click Monday at 2PM, like, on the calendar in front of you. But when you click that, you'll also press send the link, and it'll send the link to them so they can secure the time that they wanted, but you don't have to sit there and fill out, like, all the information. It's also great for newer clients because you wanna make sure you have, like, their credit card info or they know your your, like, policy for cancellation. Because, if they don't come in or whatnot, then you kinda just lost money on, their them not showing up or whatnot too. Yeah. Yeah. Just something cool that I know a lot of other, like, softwares don't do. So that's just, like, a cool tool that I always love to share. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. I wanted to ask you, do you have a good day and time that would work for you that I can send over the link for us to hop on a demo screen share? Usually, it takes about twenty five minutes, and we can actually show you what we what we do here at mangomint."

I'm gonna send the link for, our demo to that email right now, and then I will reach out. I'll probably send an email tomorrow night, again, just with the link and just so it's at the top of your inbox and just to confirm that the time still works. If for whatever reason you aren't able to make it Saturday morning, just reply back to my email. Let me know, and we can find a better time that works because I do know things pop up.

We can show you, like, packages, memberships, just anything in general that you guys wanna see. So, yeah, whatever you're comfortable with, but I would recommend an iPad probably. Okay. Cool. Yeah.

Can I just give you an idea of how we stack up against Vagaro?

We have a lot of features, but one that's very useful for spas is, like, our resources. So say that you have a specific massage table or a specific room. When somebody books online, it attaches a service provider and books out that, you know, that specific resource automatically so it doesn't get double booked. It just helps get more clients in and less time on your hands, less time for the front desk to, like, be booking all of these appointments. And it works really well with commission.

So I already kinda told you about our online booking, but our express booking is say that somebody calls on the phone. And the whole point of it is to save time, but also just, like, cover all of your bases as, like, a business owner. So what it does is all you need is their first name and their phone number. It sends them a text message, and they finish filling out their information. So a credit card on file, have them accept the cancellation policy. So if they ever do charge back, you for sure have every single client of yours accepting that cancellation policy. And then, you know, you can set it for a certain time, so hold that appointment until they officially, like, book it. And if they if say it's, you know, two hours that you set for them, if they don't do it, it takes it off the calendar and allows somebody else to book that appointment."

It's a twenty minute screen share just to show you current customers of ours, how they use mangomint, benefits using us, and really just get to know a little bit more about your business, see if potentially we would be a good fit, but mainly just to show you, like, what else is out there and and how we are different.
